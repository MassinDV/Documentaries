for risk-taking; she's really,
really exciting.

black woman to have a solo show
at the White Chapel Gallery.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.470 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
The first black woman to be
acquired by the Tate

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%

shockingly, is still the first

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:52.952 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Oh, she's undoubtedly one of
prominent woman artists working
in the UK.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.991 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; SONIA: I am quite hooked on
the mystery of what happens when
people are together and what

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.893 align:start line:10% position:10% size:20%
they do.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:04.097 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:<i> British artist</i>
<i>Sonia Boyce is about to stage a</i>
<i>performance at the Institute of</i>

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:08.034 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
<i>Contemporary Art in London for</i>
<i>a major new artwork.</i>

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:13.406 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>She's invited a vocalist and</i>
<i>dancers to perform in front of</i>
<i>a masked audience.</i>

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:18.645 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>All the action will be filmed</i>
<i>by Sonia's four person camera</i>
<i>crew, but even she has no idea</i>

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.447 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
<i>how it will unfold.</i>

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.450 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Nobody really quite knows
what's going to happen.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.119 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
It's gonna be maybe a little bit
chaotic.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:30.256 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
I'm hoping that the dancers will
kind of tease out an engagement
with the audience.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.760 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
When people kind of do things
together, particularly when
they're unexpected, there's

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.497 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
always a moment where there's
something almost like a kind of
eureka moment that kind of

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.498 align:start line:10% position:10% size:20%
happens.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:44.037 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
I think there's a certain kind
of energy, for me, that comes
when I step back a bit and allow

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.507 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
others to let the process kind
of unfold.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:53.913 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: Yeah, there's going to
be 70 people wearing masks, the
audience, and I felt very much

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.586 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
like creating a sort of
playground and that there would
be objects and bodies.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.657 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt;<i> Collaboration and</i>
<i>improvisation are very much</i>
<i>Sonia's style.</i>

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:09.562 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>She works with the element of</i>
<i>chance, bringing people</i>
<i>together to create performance</i>

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.666 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>and video works that span film,</i>
<i>music and dance.</i>

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:19.572 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
<i>But Sonia made her first</i>
<i>artistic mark in a very</i>
<i>different medium-- drawing.</i>

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:31.317 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>She was born in 1962 in</i>
<i>London's East End to parents</i>
<i>who had recently immigrated</i>

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.686 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
<i>from the Caribbean.</i>

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.089 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; So, I'm one of five children.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:42.929 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And, you know, I grew up in a
Caribbean household, which was
very, very noisy and the house

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.899 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
was always-- seems to be kind of
on the move.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.736 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I was always drawing and I never
noticed that I was always
drawing.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:55.008 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
You know, all the margins of all
my schoolbooks and any surface
that I could kind of find, I

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.544 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
would be drawing on it.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.881 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Sonia studied at prestigious</i>
<i>art school Stourbridge</i>
<i>College of Arts.</i>

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:09.956 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; And so, when I was in my
first year at Stourbridge, I was
convinced that someone in a suit

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.026 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
would come in with a clipboard
and say, "Are you Miss Boyce?

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:17.230 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I'm sorry, we've made this
terrible mistake", because I was
really shocked that I was

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.499 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
allowed to draw all day.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:23.636 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> She decided that she wanted</i>
<i>to make art that depicted her</i>
<i>own view of the world.</i>

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:28.541 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; I said to myself, "That's
what I want to do, that's
exactly what I want to do.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:34.514 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I'm going to do fine art because
I want to do work about life,
but also with a very kind of

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.317 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
edgy political sensibility."

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:48.061 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
I began by looking-- looking at
images in magazines and became
very aware that the images of

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:52.699 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
African diasporic women, you
know, black women were very
limited.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:58.104 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
Look through the art magazines,
look through the books, and most
of what I could find were books

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:06.112 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
about traditional African tribal
art or what people felt able to
say primitive art.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:11.050 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I think that's really what
gravitated her towards being an
artist, is a means to sort of

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:16.656 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
create a space that allowed her
voice and her own personal
experiences to be heard.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; It's really about inserting
herself into these kinds of
histories, into these kinds of

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:24.897 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
debates, to really kind of
redress the balance of art
history.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.503 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt;<i> Her politically charged</i>
<i>drawings tackled issues of</i>
<i>identity and belonging face</i>

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.704 align:start line:85% position:10% size:08%
<i>on.</i>

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:36.676 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>She placed herself in the</i>
<i>centre of her work, weaving</i>
<i>visual metaphors and puns into</i>

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:39.145 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
<i>her colourful imagery.</i>

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:44.550 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
<i>One of her best known works</i>
<i>from the period re-examines</i>
<i>British history.</i>

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:50.890 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I was really into William
Morris wallpapers and then there
was a wallpaper that was

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:57.563 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
designed to commemorate Queen
Victoria's 50th anniversary and
of, really, the empire.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.770 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
And in this wallpaper was the
various continents, the four
continents that the British

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.505 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
Empire ruled over.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:11.411 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I used that as a kind of
background to kind of talk about
both the church, the church's

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:15.882 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
relationship in terms of empire,
the question about colonialism.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.383 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
&gt;&gt; It's very human.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.488 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
It's dealing, sort of, very
personal issues, and yet it's
kind of being presented in this

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:25.558 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
very confident, sort of very
heroic scale as well.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.531 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; I mean, her titles are just
so fantastic and so evocative
and they raise all sorts of

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.166 align:start line:10% position:10% size:25%
questions.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:37.003 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; You see her on the right-hand
panel, kind of looking out at
the viewer, slightly

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.171 align:start line:10% position:10% size:30%
impassively.

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:42.241 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
And behind her are these kind of
Tudor roses, but they're all
turned black.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:45.111 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
They're entangled with these
cruciform shapes.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.347 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
In each one of them is a name of
a different colony.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:53.419 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
And so, thinking about these
different legacies of empire,
thinking about the ways in which

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:58.691 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
empire is completely intertwined
with the way in which histories
and narratives get built.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:03.396 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; The rose itself is a kind of
ambivalent motif-- beautiful,
fragile, but also thorny,

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.697 align:start line:10% position:10% size:30%
intractable.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:08.668 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
And that sense of ambivalence
is there throughout Sonia's
work.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:13.806 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
We look at William Morris now as
sort of representative of
quintessential English artist.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.209 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
And yet, William Morris was an
anarchist.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:19.078 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
You know, he was actually very
disruptive in his own right.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:25.118 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
And I think there is a synergy
there between a figure like
William Morris, who's

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:30.923 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
interrogating and engaged with
questions of Englishness and
representation, and Sonia Boyce,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:37.296 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
working 100 years later and
interrogating those same themes
but from a very different

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:40.366 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
experience and in a very
different context.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.770 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> The Arts Council of Britain</i>
<i>bought the pastel.</i>

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:49.375 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>They were swiftly followed by</i>
<i>Tate, who acquired two other</i>
<i>works, making Sonia-- aged just</i>

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:56.048 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>23-- the first black female</i>
<i>artist and only the fifth woman</i>
<i>in Tate's collection.</i>

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.554 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It's worth pointing out that
not every artist sort of ends up
being in national collections at

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.922 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
that early point.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:03.923 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
&gt;&gt; I was 23.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.793 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
I mean, this is just-- it's kind
of crazy.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:12.932 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
We were very, very aware of
there being-- that the status
quo was there to be challenged,

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:17.837 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
was not there to be-- to tell
us, "Okay, this is what you
think" and you just follow it.

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:22.942 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
It was our job, in a way, to
challenge things.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Sonia's performance has just</i>
<i>wrapped.</i>

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:31.851 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>Rather than lasting half an</i>
<i>hour as predicted, it went on</i>
<i>for two hours, as the audience</i>

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:37.690 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
<i>became more involved, eagerly</i>
<i>responding to Sonia's</i>
<i>invitation to play</i>

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:43.830 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I mean, we wanted-- we wanted
the performers to get the
audience members involved, but I

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:49.869 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
didn't realize the extent to
which they would really just--
people just wanted to play.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:53.673 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; We didn't know what to expect
and we were worried the whole
time that people wouldn't do

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.674 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
anything.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.677 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
And actually, the opposite
happened, that through the
course of the performance and

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.480 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
what unfolded, we actually
couldn't get the audience to
stop.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.482 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
They sort of became very
involved and it continued.

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:08.654 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And that's what's fascinating
and that was the confidence and
the trust that Sonia had, that

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.389 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
she knew something would happen.

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:15.228 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
The mask, I think, did operate
in the way that Sonia hoped, in
which there was a sort of

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:19.532 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
letting go that took place
during the course of the
performance.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:23.769 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; She used her own portrait,
but it's not quite clear that
it's Sonia, and created these

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:29.008 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
masks which she gave to the
audience so that they had a
licence to enter into the work

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:34.981 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
and participate without being
identifiable or, I suppose,
exposed.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:39.418 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; As an experience, that was
just totally off the charts.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:44.056 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I'm actually beaming, thinking
that was-- that was quite
extraordinary.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Britain in the early 80s was
quite a bitter, embattled place.

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:57.036 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
Thatcher had recently come to
power, unemployment was on the
up, you had the rioting in

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.906 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
Liverpool, Brixton, Southall.

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:04.477 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
So, it was quite an edgy place.

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:09.482 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
Borne out of this tumultuous
time, the black arts movement
was started by young people

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:12.518 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
fighting for their place in
society.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:17.890 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; So, in 1980s Britain, the
idea of a mainstream,
homogenous British identity was

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:21.827 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
something that was being
challenged by a whole range of
artists and filmmakers and

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:27.667 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
writers, and it was into this
context that Sonia emerged,
amongst a group who are really

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:33.806 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
giving voice to a different
notion and idea of what it was
to be British, and it was a

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.808 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
very, very exciting time.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:39.645 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; She was a key part of a sort
of very activist black arts
movement.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:44.917 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
It was about ideas and how you
can articulate messages that
need to be heard more widely.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:49.488 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; The idea that a bunch of
young artists were going to come
along, who have been brought up

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:56.128 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
here and were going to use the
experience of having grown up in
quite a disadvantaged, embattled

00:09:56.195 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
situation on many levels and
actually put that into art, I
mean, that was something that

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.570 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
the British art scene was not
prepared for.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:12.445 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; At that point, I was really
wanting to make images that
somehow described not only who I

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:16.415 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
was, but the context which I--
from which I was coming from.

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:21.520 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
I wasn't doing it in terms of
thinking, "Oh, this is about
making history" or anything.

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:26.559 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
It was just, "Yeah, okay, you
know, let's just do this,"
without thought, really, about

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.627 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
what it meant historically.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:35.134 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> Sonia's focus on family and</i>
<i>the domestic space shone a</i>
<i>light on a community that,</i>

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:39.472 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>until then, was barely scene in</i>
<i>British museums.</i>

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:44.210 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; "She Ain't Holding Them Up,
She's Holding On (Some English
Rose)" is an extraordinary work.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:50.182 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I mean, you can see already
Sonia's interest in the idea of
the artist as this catalyst,

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:54.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
this trigger, this activator of
narrative.

00:10:55.054 --> 00:11:00.626 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I was particularly making
reference to, you know, the kind
of domestic space and the

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:04.730 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
particular kind of domestic
space within the kind of
Caribbean household, which is

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:09.435 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
very, very patterned and very
kind of quite sensual.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:13.105 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
There's always a lot of colour
and a lot of texture.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:20.379 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And the work, I think, is a
really key work, not just for
Sonia, but also for British art

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:27.019 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
because it's the first time, in
the national collection of
British art, there is a work

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:32.992 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
which is addressing what it
means to be a black British
woman.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:37.496 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Sonia's interest in black</i>
<i>identity inspired her to make</i>
<i>a new work about the popular</i>

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.565 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
<i>fictional character Tarzan.</i>

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:47.740 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; The piece was about kind of
deconstructing not only, you
know, this figure of Tarzan,

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:57.283 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
who, you know, is this white
male who grows up in the jungle
and is able to master that space

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:59.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
better than people who've lived
there for centuries.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:07.393 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
Invariably, the black subjects
that are rallied around him were
indecipherable.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.761 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
They're not able to speak.

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.096 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
They're incoherent.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.498 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
They are often stupid.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:17.703 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
They're unable to work out the
things that he's managed to work
out, you know, as this lone

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.071 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
figure.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:24.577 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And so, the piece was about kind
of deconstructing all of that,
all of those kinds of narratives

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:31.417 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
going on as a way of trying to
think through how we relate to
representation.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:36.255 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Like a lot of Sonia's work at
the time, this is really
thinking about how is identity

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:40.893 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
produced, how is identity
constructed, how is gender
constructed.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
And to this, she often turns to
collage.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.667 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And this kind of pick and mix
approach she does particularly
deftly, I think, and from Tarzan

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:49.902 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
to Rambo.

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:53.572 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And there's a certain kind of
level of performance here, the
way in which the self becomes

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.874 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
performed.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:01.714 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; So, the reason why I was
using collage, in a way, it was
my pathway into thinking about

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:07.086 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
the moving image and actually
creating moving images, working
with collage.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:11.090 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> It would have been easy for</i>
<i>Sonia to continue working in</i>
<i>this way.</i>

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:15.528 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>But ever restless and curious</i>
<i>for new things, from this point</i>
<i>on, she started to work</i>

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:19.431 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
<i>exclusively in video and</i>
<i>performance.</i>

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:25.838 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I no longer wanted to start
with a kind of clear narrative,
so to speak.

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:31.343 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And I suppose I realized in
doing some of that work where I
was centre of the work that,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.348 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
actually, I found it much more
interesting for other people to
kind of take that kind of centre

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:37.750 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
stage.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:42.621 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Just as some of those early
works were different expressions
of identity or investigations

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
into identity, what performance
and moving image allowed her to
do was to approach these kinds

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of questions with other people.

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
It was her allowing a degree of
chance, of improvisation, and
importantly, of collaboration

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:55.301 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
into the work, too.

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:58.504 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
So, it's a way of kind of
opening the work out onto the
world.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.207 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Actually, I think that her
true medium is people.

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:05.177 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
You know, it's working with
people and it's working with
others, and that actually video

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:11.083 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
and sound offers that kind of
forum to sort of work in the
kind of way that now suits her

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
in the way she wants to express
her ideas.

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:18.757 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
(Singing operatically)
&gt;&gt;<i> By working with video, Sonia</i>

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:24.897 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:30.069 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

&gt;&gt; SONIA: I was just so struck
by the way that he-- the way he

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:58.530 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
performs and kind of
non-linguistic use of very kind
of guttural sounds, bodily

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
sounds in his performance.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:05.838 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
Mikhail works a very different
way to, you know, kind of
Renaissance, highly structured

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.206 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
way of singing.

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
The choir were really troubled
by what Mikhail had done with
this piece of choral music by

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:15.414 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
Josquin Desprez.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:20.152 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
But what Mikhail had done is he
chopped it up and rearranged,
so that there were half

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:24.590 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
sentences and it was familiar
and unfamiliar to them.

(Vocalizing)

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:37.503 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; You have this extraordinary
kind of dance that goes on
between these two pieces of

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:46.211 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
sound and music-- the choir
singing and Mikhail Karikis'
improvised sound piece, which is

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.346 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
guttural.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.415 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
It sounds like animal noises.

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:57.323 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
That piece is very much about
how we receive and understand
something that's different,

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:02.861 align:start line:74% position:10% size:63%
that's unfamiliar, that's
strange, and how we open
ourselves up to actually

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.731 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
embracing that difference.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:11.603 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And it's a very resonant piece
in terms of the times we live
in, you know, the question of

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:20.646 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
how we embrace the stranger, the
foreigner, the unfamiliar is a
key question for our times.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:29.521 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And actually, it's continued
to make me think about what
representation, not only might

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
look like, but also might sound
like.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sonia started looking at</i>
<i>black female singers in</i>

<i>Britain.</i>

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:44.503 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>She was captivated by the</i>
<i>story of little known singer</i>
<i>Adelaide Hall.</i>

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Adelaide was a singer in the
1930's.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:57.282 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
She knew Duke Ellington and she
made one of the earliest jazz
scat records with Duke

00:16:57.349 --> 00:17:04.256 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Ellington, which is-- a piece of
which we used at the end of this
film "Oh Adelaide".

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:10.062 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; So, the piece is very much
also about what's visible, what
we acknowledge culturally,

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
what's part of a shared history
and narrative of our shared
culture, and what gets eclipsed

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:18.937 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
what gets forgotten.

hard sound that...

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:45.764 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
My whole imagining has kind of
expanded and multiplied to try
and think about to kind of

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:53.372 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
capture a sense of it without
trying to do a-- it's not like a
documentary of what took place.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:57.142 align:start line:74% position:10% size:58%
It's really how to make
something from all that
material.

00:17:57.209 --> 00:18:01.647 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
It's like sculpting, really, but
it's sculpting with kind of the
video material and the sound

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.015 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
material.

seriously interested in how

I do this and I do this every
day."

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
I'm not that kind of artist
who's very systematic.

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:34.480 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And I, you know-- I'm wanting it
to be a kind of journey of
discovery in a way.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:42.788 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Always fascinated by the</i>
<i>unpredictable nature of</i>
<i>improvisation, British artist</i>

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>Sonia Boyce took on a new</i>
<i>project at the Villa Arson-- a</i>
<i>renowned art school in the</i>

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
<i>hills behind Nice.</i>

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.863 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; So, the site is stunning.

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:57.135 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
All of the wonder of surrealism
is kind of built into that
space.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:19:04.309 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And I wanted to work with the
students, and it was chaotic and
it was tremendously energizing.

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:09.381 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I think it released something in
the students, in everybody,
actually.

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:14.052 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And by the end of it, the
students, basically, were
leading what was happening and

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:19.725 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
they were making the most
extraordinary animal sounds, and
it was hilarious but really

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.026 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
spooky.

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:27.266 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And there isn't-- I don't know
why that happened, but it just
did, it just kind of rose to the

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
surface.

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:32.571 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Rather than projecting what
might happen, she's genuinely
interested to see what might

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:36.775 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
happen, and then that's the
material that she then uses for
her artwork.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:42.781 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Once again, she's activating the
artwork by creating the space,
by bringing these people

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:46.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
together, and then wants to see
what happens.

00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:52.824 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
It's trusting in the process of
collaboration, of bringing
different people together.

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:59.164 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt;<i> It's opening night at</i>
<i>London's ICA and Sonia's new</i>
<i>work is about to go on show.</i>

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:03.902 align:end line:74% position:88% size:78%
<i>The finished art work spans two</i>
<i>rooms with seven different</i>
<i>screens and specially designed</i>

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:08.373 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
<i>wallpaper inviting visitors</i>
<i>into the space.</i>

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.078 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; So, we're first day of the
actual exhibition of the work.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:19.484 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
Although we didn't start out
thinking about it as a kind of
multi-screened installation,

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:25.891 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
because there was so many angles
from which the performance was
filmed, started to wonder,

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:31.697 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
"Well, is it possible then to do
something that happens
simultaneously across different

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.732 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
screens?"

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:38.203 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
I mean, also, the idea of not
having one perspective, you
know, but there are multiple

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:44.610 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
perspectives on any given
situation, and that's really, in
terms of trying to configure the

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:49.948 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
installation, trying to think
about people having-- not being
able to see everything all at

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:53.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
once, it's not all laid out for
everybody.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:57.723 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
You have to kind of move in
order to get a sense that there
are these different things going

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:58.724 align:start line:85% position:10% size:08%
on.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.726 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
People might engage with each
other.

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:04.796 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
You know, I don't know what will
happen in this space over a
period of exhibition.

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:09.101 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; MARK: I think the initial
impression of it is quite
unfathomable. I mean, you've got

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:12.204 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
six viewpoints unfolding
simultaneously.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.375 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
You don't quite know which one
you're supposed to be looking at
and in what order.

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:21.380 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
But gradually, you're kind of
surrounded by the experience of
this performance, almost as

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.482 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
though you're part of it
yourself.

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:27.753 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; KATHARINE: Although it's not
sort of foregrounded in the
work, it was against a backdrop

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:30.489 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
of quite extraordinary
political, social times.

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:35.627 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
So, at the heart of this work is
the idea of, you know, the title
is "We Move In Her Way", which

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:39.631 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
can be read either positive or
negative, whether that's a
enabling factor or an

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.133 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
obstructive factor.

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:46.738 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
But against a backdrop of really
what, for a new generation, are
sort of concerning issues about

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:51.910 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
the idea of a woman in power and
how that is then regarded in the
media.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:57.249 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
That actually provided a
backdrop, in a way, that also
kind of gave it sort of an extra

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.151 align:start line:10% position:10% size:45%
resonance as well.

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:06.758 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; GILANE: And I think Sonia was
particularly drawn to the idea
of an artist who was not making

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:16.535 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
objects, but was actually
creating environments and
triggering the participation of

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:20.272 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
the audience in a very dynamic
and interesting way.

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:23.809 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
And it broke down the barrier
between an artist and a viewer.

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:29.347 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
The audience actually has a very
active role to play in
completing the artwork.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.054 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; SAM: I think art is a place
that doesn't take us away from
life.

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:39.658 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
It's not a kind of place of
fantasy or escape or removal.

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:43.328 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
It's actually a lens that brings
us closer to the world.

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:48.734 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
So, I think the artist Sonia
Boyce, in all of her complexity,
is really starting to emerge in

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.569 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
a new way.

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:55.974 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GILANE: You know, it's very
important to recognize that
Sonia's work has consistently

00:22:56.041 --> 00:23:04.182 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
broken boundaries and been at
the vanguard of forms of
artistic practice in Britain and

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.018 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
has been extraordinarily
influential.

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:12.290 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I am quite hooked on, you
know, the mystery of what
happens when people are together

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:13.525 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
and what they do.

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:16.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And that's why I work this way.

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:22.701 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
You know, I don't know that-- I
don't know that me sitting in
the studio on my own would ever

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.136 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
produce anything like that.

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:26.838 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
And always there's something
unexpected.

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:30.642 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
I never know what's going to
come 'round the corner.
