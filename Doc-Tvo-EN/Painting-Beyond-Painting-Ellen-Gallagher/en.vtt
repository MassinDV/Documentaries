&gt;&gt; ZOE: Ellen Gallagher's
work, for me, is all about wit
and skill.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:04.664 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
I think there are few artists
who possess the skill that she
does, just thinking about her

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:11.704 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
approach to materials, her
draftsmanship, the-- the quality
of ideas, but equally, that

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.308 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
she's often able to do that in
such a playful and inclusive
way.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.710 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
To me, that's what makes all the
difference.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:24.417 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Her work is attractive not
merely on a visual level, but
because it is work that seems to

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:32.392 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
encourage you to join her in the
process of inquiry that she is
on, rather than being something

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.464 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
which is confrontational or
excluding or exclusive.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.837 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
And I think the way that she is
able to encourage us to make
these connections through work

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:50.343 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
that is technically incredibly
accomplished and visually
extraordinary beautiful and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.245 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
culturally very, very rich.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:57.116 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
I find her work fascinating.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:01.488 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> Ellen Gallagher burst onto</i>
<i>the contemporary art scene in</i>
<i>the early '90s, and caught the</i>

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:05.391 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
<i>attention of curators and</i>
<i>collectors alike.</i>

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.260 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I immediately liked her work.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:13.166 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
In every case, they were
fantastic and really powerful
and important, and you could see

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:17.136 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
that she was gonna be a great
artist.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:21.107 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt;<i> Although one of the most</i>
<i>highly regarded American</i>
<i>artists in the world, for</i>

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.777 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>Ellen, creating work is full of</i>
<i>challenge.</i>

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.048 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; There's this thing that
happens when you-- when you're
starting work, not just when

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.049 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
you're starting it.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:36.656 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
You can be well into it, and
it's just not happening, and you
ride home on your bike, and it's

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.625 align:start line:10% position:10% size:45%
the worst feeling.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:44.163 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
It's just the worst possible
feeling, and it's really
unresolvable.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.869 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
So what's really nice are those
few times where you go home and
you're like-- there's literally

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:55.241 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
a-a thread connecting you back
to the studio, 'cause you can't
wait to get back.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.984 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
The work becomes a being,
and-- and...that's, for me, the
most perfect time in the work.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.053 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
That's the best.

&gt;&gt;<i> Ellen was born in 1965 on the</i>
<i>East Coast of America to an</i>
<i>African-American father and an</i>

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.197 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
<i>Irish Catholic mother.</i>

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:27.340 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; My sister and I were raised
by my mom in Providence, Rhode
Island, and so it was sort of

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:31.911 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
the three of us, this kind of
core of the family.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:37.584 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
My mom was really seen as, you
know, that was sort of out that
she did that, you know, had two

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.990 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
daughters on her own in-- you
know, in the '60s, and now I
think that's not really a big

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.224 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
deal, if you think about it.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:49.862 align:start line:74% position:10% size:58%
I had a really, pretty
straightforward, normal
childhood.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:04:00.607 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
I remember when I was really
little, the first painting I saw
was in my school, and it was a

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:07.146 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
Botero of fat children, and it
made me cry, and I thought it
was really a hideous thing, and

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.881 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
it scared the shit out of me.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:13.119 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
I just don't think-- I don't
like the work, and I think it
terrified me as a child and

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.389 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
still does, I don't know.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.826 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
And then there are some works
that I saw really early on that
really stuck with me.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:24.731 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
Like, my mom had, you know,
these kind of posters around the
house, of art.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:31.471 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
There was abstract poster she
had, and I never noticed until--
I think I was a teenager and

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:36.142 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
moving out of the house, that
woven into it, it said, "Black
is beautiful," and I-I loved

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.645 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
that-- to discover that.

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
And then I had a really amazing
literature teacher, Blossom
Kirschenbaum, who was just the

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.156 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
most wild teacher.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:55.028 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I mean, you know, she had me
reading, like, Bernard Malamud,
at, you know, age 14, and, you

00:04:55.094 --> 00:05:00.166 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
know, and Sinclair Lewis and
Toni Morrison, you know, and
really creating this portrait of

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.535 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
America through what we read.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And Blossom was really a-- Mrs.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.208 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
Kirschenbaum, actually-- I'm
saying Blossom now, but-- 'cause
I'm older, but she was-- you

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:18.084 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
know, she is an incredible,
visual person who made you see
things, and not just read things

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:24.657 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
and comprehend them, but that
they were actually visions that
had meaning.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:28.394 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> After graduating from high</i>

<i>Rhode Island and travel to</i>

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.364 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
<i>Boston to attend art college.</i>

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And even then, I wasn't sure
that I would be an artist.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:42.175 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I think I didn't really decide
that I would try to be an artist
until I went to a summer program

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:51.884 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
in Maine called Skowhegan, and
that's when I-- I'm think-- I
decided that I would just try.

&gt;&gt;<i> Little did Ellen know that</i>

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.993 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

<i>Skowhegan would rapidly make</i>

<i>of the New York art scene.</i>

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:15.074 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; That whole<i> Oh! Susanna</i> series
in the-- in the mid-90s, I think
really grabbed everyone's

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:22.215 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
attention in a very-- in a very
undeniable way.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:27.253 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Ellen's piece,</i> Oh! Susanna

<i>enduringly popular 19th century</i>

<i>minstrel song.</i>

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:37.964 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>The lips and eyes in this work</i>
<i>mimic the makeup used by</i>
<i>singers, comedians and dancers</i>

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.301 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
<i>to represent Black characters</i>
<i>on stage.</i>

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:48.741 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; It's basically just this
top-to-bottom, left-to-right
penmanship paper grid, and the

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:54.547 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
lips are generally-- it's like
skin, my skin tone, brownish,
and then into that, I started

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:59.952 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
this map of my idea of what--
what was a blonde lady.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:03.222 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
So, the ladies seemed to be
activating this minstrel show.

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:10.563 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; There was something about
coming across those kind of
braille-like details of the

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.002 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
eyes and the lips, disembodied,
and then once you're able to
figure out what they're actually

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:21.274 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
referencing, that they're able
to disembody such a painful part
of American history, a painful

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.444 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
part of my history and the
artist's history, all of our
histories, and do it in a way

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:33.352 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
that managed to be playful and
funny and subversive, and I'd
never seen anything like it.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.324 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> By now, based in New York,</i>
<i>Ellen would continue to use</i>
<i>humour and satire to explore</i>

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:44.363 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>the complexities of</i>
<i>African-American history, such</i>
<i>as her piece,</i> Deluxe.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:53.673 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I think she's best-known for
her very large-scale, grid-like
compositions drawn from

00:07:53.739 --> 00:08:00.279 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
advertising in American
magazines in ebony and sepia,
drawn from the late '30s through

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:07.253 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
to the 1960s, and these adverts
for wigs, hair-lightening
products so predominantly aimed

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.992 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
at women, but men as well, she
then manipulates and abstracts
with a whole range of material

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:21.200 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
from Plasticine, glitter,
coconut oil, and really
playfully makes us think about

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:29.175 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
issues as diverse as race and
gender and consumerism and
society.

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:32.979 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; And when they first came out,
they looked so fresh, and they
were so different, and that's

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:35.481 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
just as true now.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:41.888 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
So I think, effectively, she's
been able to play very well with
the language of advertisement,

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:45.958 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
but to feed us back something
new, so we're not getting back
the same thing in a way that's

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.027 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
like pop art, say.

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:52.531 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
The commentary comes in a much
more nuanced fashion.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:57.904 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; For example, the black faces
become white, and-- and she uses
things like Plasticine as well,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.842 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
to create a sort of absurdness
to something that was actually
quite a dark chapter in American

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.911 align:start line:10% position:10% size:20%
history.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:12.151 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; I don't want to make a
picture of something that you
already think you know.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.821 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
I don't want to sort of-- I'm
not making a critique in this
sense.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.858 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
It's absolutely not that.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:24.530 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I want to make a picture of
something I feel like we are,
together, making language for,

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:27.533 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:38.170 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
It's also, for me, it's in--
in-- it's the brownest city I've
been in in Europe, in terms of,

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.840 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
like, the cultural mix of
people.

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:45.044 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
And that's important.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:50.249 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I think also just being directly
on the port in this really
matter-of-fact way, that it's a

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.517 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
working port.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:58.924 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
It's not, at all, this kind of
American space, and that-- that,
in a sense, my work here isn't--

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:03.829 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
um...it's not defined as such.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:09.869 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And so, I feel like there's--
there's a lot of potential here
for the work to grow.

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:13.305 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> But it wasn't just a change</i>
<i>of scene that prompted Ellen's</i>
<i>move.</i>

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:17.943 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
<i>She came to Rotterdam to live</i>
<i>with Dutch artist Edgar</i>
<i>Cleijne.</i>

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:24.750 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>And it wasn't long before their</i>
<i>personal relationship also</i>
<i>turned professional.</i>

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:28.020 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: His practice comes
from a more documentary
practice, and he's also a

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:36.328 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
musician, so musicians are
always in the world, and I am a
little bit, um, separate in some

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:37.329 align:start line:10% position:10% size:13%
ways.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:43.869 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
My temperament keeps me that
way, so this is sort of a
balance.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:57.783 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt;<i> Edgar has a background in</i>
<i>film, video and animation.</i>

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.287 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
<i>Working together, their first</i>
<i>video work was</i> Murmur.

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:10.663 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; I think I had to pull you
into<i> Murmur,</i> at first.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:12.932 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
You weren't interested in the
beginning.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.967 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
I always wanted to work with
Edgar.

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:20.806 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
I mean, I met Edgar-- see, I
saw his work in Korea, and so, I
think I always really responded

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
to it and thought it was really
lucid and in the world, but I
don't know that you really

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.745 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
wanted to work on films with me.

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:31.417 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
(Chuckling)
&gt;&gt; EDGAR: It is fairly easy to
actually have the ideas.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:38.124 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
It is much more difficult to
actually make-- make the films
and actually make them happen.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:44.363 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
That-- that is a bit-- the
problem with animation, 'cause
they take so much work and such

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.601 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
a long time that some of us lose
interest.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.669 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
(Chuckling)

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.010 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> The couple are currently</i>
<i>working on ideas for a new</i>
<i>piece, which will explore what</i>

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:03.883 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>they see as man's continued</i>
<i>disregard for nature and the</i>
<i>environment.</i>

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:08.721 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
&gt;&gt; The idea for the film,
eventually, is...

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:16.629 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
That somewhere in a parallel
universe or a future, we have
decided as a human species to--

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:25.804 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
that we cannot live together
with nature, and so we make a
radical split and nature is

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:32.711 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
transported to a subterranean
world, and man lives on the
outer shell.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:36.882 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> Although the collaborations</i>
<i>with Edgar came later in her</i>
<i>work, Ellen has always sought</i>

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.951 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
<i>inspiration from others.</i>

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:47.927 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; It's that kind of
surprisingly collaborative
nature in her personality, of

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:52.665 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
not only wanting to-- to work
with others, but to find out
where others are coming from,

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:58.237 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
that I think then ends up
finding its way into the work
in a lot of ways.

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:02.074 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Working with other artists</i>
<i>or on her own, Ellen keeps</i>
<i>returning to her greatest</i>

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.143 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
<i>inspiration: books.</i>

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.212 align:start line:10% position:10% size:45%
&gt;&gt; I love to read.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:11.150 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
It affects me physically, and it
makes me see other
possibilities.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:14.386 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
I mean, I guess that sounds
corny, but it's just really
true.

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:19.692 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt;<i> It was one book in particular</i>
<i>that would help Ellen realize</i>
<i>one of her best-known works.</i>

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:27.233 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; In 2009, Philip Hoare's book,
<i>Leviathan</i> had just come out,
and, you know, I complete-- I

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:28.267 align:start line:10% position:10% size:40%
went through it.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:34.473 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
I mean, I devoured it, and it
gave me a lot of courage for
<i>Osedax.</i>

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:41.914 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
It led me to, you know, continue
looking into this idea of whale
fall, which is what it's based

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.983 align:start line:10% position:10% size:08%
on.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:51.590 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I made this piece that was about
the Osedax worm, which is where
it gets its title from, and this

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:57.162 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
worms that bores into whale
carcasses at the bottom of the
ocean.

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.498 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
This sort of cycle of the kind
of whale fall.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:06.338 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
This idea of whales constantly
falling through the ocean and
becoming a kind of ecosystem,

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:10.542 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
and then continuing, and then
that-- those worms sort of
becoming becoming like

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:17.049 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
dandelions and spreading out,
and start-- and looking again
for more whale fall.

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:22.888 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; I think there's very much a
sense of how film is able to
tell a particular story that

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:27.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
perhaps couldn't be told in any
other way.

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:34.900 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Whilst Ellen and Edgar</i>
<i>continue to make installations,</i>
<i>it is her most recent paintings</i>

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:38.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
<i>that are considered to be some</i>
<i>of her finest work.</i>

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:48.947 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ANTHONY: Everything she's
done before make sense, seeing
these new pictures, but the new

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:52.985 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
pictures in it were beyond
anything she'd done before.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:59.224 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
She gets stronger and stronger,
and I think more and more people
realize just how important she

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.593 align:start line:10% position:10% size:08%
is.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.565 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> These latest works combine,</i>
<i>in virtuosic skill with</i>
<i>references drawn from history,</i>

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:12.538 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
<i>literature and geography, were</i>
<i>made for the grandest stage of</i>
<i>all: the Venice Biennale.</i>

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:25.551 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
<i>This is the Venice Biennale;</i>
<i>one of the most prestigious</i>

<i>calendar.</i>

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:30.989 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>And Ellen Gallagher has been</i>
<i>invited to exhibit a series of</i>
<i>new works, each of which</i>

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:35.094 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
<i>incorporate painting, drawings</i>
<i>and collage.</i>

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.432 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I really think that themes
in the work travel in and out of
paintings and drawings, and I

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:45.604 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
think, a lot of times, people
categorize things by...

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:50.309 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
You know, they want to
categorize things as drawing or
painting or film, you know, and

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:53.245 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
for me, it's all one thing.

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:57.549 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> As well as using an array of</i>
<i>different media, Ellen has</i>
<i>drawn inspiration from a wide</i>

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.984 align:start line:10% position:10% size:45%
<i>range of subjects.</i>

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:04.289 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>From literature to the physical</i>
<i>beauty of the islands that</i>
<i>make up the Caribbean.</i>

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:16.568 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; For me, the interesting thing
about the archipelago, or the
idea of the archipelago, is that

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:23.609 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
it's this flip that happens
consciously, where it's-- it's
in this one sense, it's a

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
description, originally, of the
sea, a broken up sea, or the
first sea.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:34.853 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And on the other hand, it's--
I've always understood it as a
particular set of islands or

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:41.760 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
nations together, so it could be
Cabo Verde, or it could be, you
know, Hawaii, or it could be,

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:44.430 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
you know, the Caribbean.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:50.569 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
But the idea of it being both a
kind of visible space and it--
and a less visible or less

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:54.440 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
readable space, it's interesting
to me that they exist together.

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.648 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt;<i> But it's not just islands</i>
<i>that inspired Ellen.</i>

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:05.117 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
<i>It's also the ocean itself.</i>

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Going underwater, for me, is
really inspirational.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.695 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
I mean, it's-- it's more
exciting to me than ideas of
space travel.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.964 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
I guess because it's more
tangible.

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:25.737 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
This idea that it appears to be
the surface that you see, but in
fact, it's like all these

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:30.242 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
actions that might just give
this particular colour grey
today.

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:35.047 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
You know, but they're are, like,
a million things coming together
that make that happen, and I-I

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:43.288 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
find that really a beautiful and
that's-- that's true today, but
it might not be true tomorrow.

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:47.626 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Ellen's fascination with the</i>
<i>Caribbean in particular began</i>
<i>during a formative journey she</i>

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:50.696 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
<i>took to the island of</i>
<i>Martinique, age just 20.</i>

00:18:54.032 --> 00:19:02.708 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Sailing, you know, from New
England to the Caribbean, you--
you actually-- you sort of sense

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:08.447 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
this passage of time that's not
so great, and it's-- it's
immense in a sense, you've

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:13.118 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
ended up some place, and all of
the sudden, everybody at the
docks was brown-skinned.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:20.025 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
Some variation of brown, and I
couldn't-- I'd never seen, like,
you know, it's like I-I landed

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.326 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
on a new planet.

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.428 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
I'd never seen a brown planet
before.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:29.668 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
I'd never seen a Black nation
before, coming from Rhode
Island, and-- and at the same

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:35.073 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
time, so it was like I'd
entered-- you know, was my
first experience of Africa in a

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.909 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
sense, I think.

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:42.581 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
It's exciting to-- to feel
connected to places, and that
you're actually-- can pull

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:46.952 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
sometimes-- can pull it into the
work.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:56.228 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Ellen's final inspiration</i>
<i>for the series came in the form</i>
<i>of poems by Martinican writer,</i>

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:59.698 align:start line:79% position:10% size:58%
<i>Aimé Césaire, about the</i>
<i>Caribbean archipelago.</i>

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:05.003 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; He writes poems that deal
with this idea of a kind of
interlocked membrane that exists

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.341 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
throughout the Caribbean nation,
and that there's a kind of, you
know, as if it could be a

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:10.876 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
nation.

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Césaire imagines the islands</i>
<i>of the Caribbean forever bound</i>
<i>together by the shared memory</i>

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.951 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
<i>of the horrors of slavery.</i>

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:23.555 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: And so, he creates a
kind of life force, but it's a
life force that's forged in this

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:24.723 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
crucible of pain.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:30.095 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
So I came up with this-- this
idea of a kind of vertebrae,
something that's both separate

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:31.229 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
and hinged together.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:36.001 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I mean, and I like that flip
between negative, positive, like
the archipelago as a group of

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:42.074 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
islands, but also as a
disturbance within the sea.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.678 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Ellen's ability to weave so</i>
<i>many ideas into her work is why</i>
<i>many feel she's one of the most</i>

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
<i>exciting artist working today.</i>

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:59.691 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; She draws incredibly widely
in terms of her references, so
popular culture from advertising

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:06.465 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
in the media, from American
historic popular culture, so
minstrel, particularly, but also

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:12.704 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
literature from Melville to
Gertrude Stein, and again,
referencing art and music, and I

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:18.610 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
think there are hooks for so
many people to enter her work,
to approach her work, because if

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:23.415 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
a reference-- one reference
escapes you, another will chime.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:34.693 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; As a museum curator, I think
our roles are constantly to
think about how we look after

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:40.899 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
collections for future
generations and-- and build on
those, and I absolutely see

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:46.071 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
Ellen Gallagher as one of the
artists whose work will stand
the test of time, and I think

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:51.543 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
the body of work that she's
created is so substantial since
the 1990s to the present, that

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.183 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
what we're able to see is not
only a very particular and
singular evolution of one

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:04.189 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
artist's practice, but the way
in which she's taken on many
other references, the way she's

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:06.058 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
collaborated with others.

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:12.364 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And we're able to glimpse, in
her work, I think, really, the
evolution of the nature of

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.433 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
contemporary art.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:25.977 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I think it's fascinating how
she uses her background as an
inspiration for her art.

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:29.581 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And I also find it really
interesting that because there
isn't so much of a history or

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:35.387 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
an archive of Black history in
this particular genre, she
creates a new Black archive.

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:44.529 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> One of America's leading</i>
<i>artists for over 25 years,</i>
<i>Ellen is surprised at just how</i>

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.965 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
<i>far she's come.</i>

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:52.637 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I certainly didn't think I'd
be talking to you by-- in a port
in Rotterdam.

00:22:52.704 --> 00:23:02.514 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
I mean, I think I imagined, you
know, I would have liked a sort
of clean studio like I had in

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:07.719 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
Boston, and I sort of wonder
where that all went.

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:14.259 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And I sort of realize that no
matter what I did, I would be
sitting pretty much alone in a

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:18.263 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
room, drawing, for the rest of
my life.
