&gt;&gt; She's a kind of a beast, in a
good sense, of course.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.342 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Her work is incredibly
intense and full of suffering.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.944 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:52.185 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.439 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%

<i>performance into the</i>

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.673 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
<i>mainstream.</i>

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.674 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.376 align:start line:10% position:10% size:15%
Go in.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:21.347 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.987 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; The artist must be beautiful.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:32.425 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Performance art is what it
says on the tin-- it's art that
is live performance.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:36.129 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
The actual live event is the
artwork.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.075 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Material art, you see the
painting on the wall, you see
projection of the video

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.844 align:start line:10% position:10% size:33%
installation.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.650 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
But performance is only about
experience, about feeling, and
that's the real difficulty

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.221 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
because that immateriality, it's
fleeting.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.656 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
It's there, and then, it's gone.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:08.194 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It's part of the impulse
where the artist can be the work
of art as well as the initiator

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.329 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
of the work of art.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:14.434 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
In a post-photographic age, she
wants to do it as directly as
possible, with her own body.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.104 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; She's strong, fantastic woman
with this iron will.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:23.843 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
There's been quite a lot of male
performance artists, you know,
famously shooting themselves,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.714 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
Joseph Beuys in a room with a
wolf, you know, lots of
mythology.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.782 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
I mean, she makes myths.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:34.554 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt;<i> Abramovic works with an</i>
<i>almost demented dedication.</i>

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:39.592 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
<i>Her early performances were</i>
<i>often shocking and intensely</i>
<i>physical.</i>

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:46.633 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
<i>In 1974, she performed the now</i>
<i>legendary</i> Rhythm 0-- a
ground-breaking six hour work

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.670 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
where she relinquished all
control to her audience.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.506 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; There she was, at a table,
with 72 objects...

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.608 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; From knives to flowers...

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.677 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ...barbed wire, olive oil...

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.212 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt; TIM: ...pens to paint...

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.815 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; LOUISA: ...a loaded gun, and
she sat there, and for six
hours, anybody could do what

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.051 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
they wanted with them or her.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:08.755 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
And by the end of it, I mean,
she was injured, her clothes had
been cut off, somebody had held

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.223 align:start line:10% position:10% size:50%
the gun to her head.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.094 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
She showed in a way how brutish,
you know, any audience can
become.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:21.601 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; My first performances in the
'70s, which had been completely
criticized, been terrible

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.102 align:start line:10% position:10% size:58%
articles in newspapers.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.006 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
You know, considered as this is
not art at all.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:31.844 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; She was breaking new ground
and problematic ground because
she was, you know, a gorgeous

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.180 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
looking woman, using her
gorgeous body.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:38.017 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
I mean, those early performances
were extraordinary, and no one
else was doing them, no one else

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
was pushing themselves to that
limit.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.020 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
&gt;&gt; She tortured herself.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.088 align:start line:10% position:10% size:50%
She whipped herself.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.024 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
She cut a star into her stomach
with a razor.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.361 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
She passed out from lack of
oxygen in a fire piece.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
These were extreme works.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.798 align:start line:10% position:10% size:50%
She could have died.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.301 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; There are people who are very
dismissive of performance art.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:58.638 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
They've never seen a Marina
Abramovic performance and
they've never met her.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.441 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
She'd soon put them right.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: An artist is given a
gift to create.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.346 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
This gift is not his own.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.682 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
He have to serve this gift.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:14.387 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
I think suicide is unacceptable
because you're not allowed to
suicide if you have this kind of

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:17.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
gift because you have to go all
the way.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.196 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
It's difficult and it's hard,
and that's why we--
responsibility.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:32.171 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
To perform is to sacrifice all--
family, privacy, children,
whatever-- and there I am.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.641 align:start line:10% position:10% size:38%
&gt;&gt; BOTH: Ahh...

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:40.747 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Abramovic's work explores</i>
<i>extremes of human experience,</i>
<i>from violence, to ritual, to</i>

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.148 align:start line:10% position:10% size:13%
<i>love.</i>

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:47.854 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>When she met fellow performance</i>
<i>artist Ulay in 1976, they</i>
<i>embarked on both a passionate</i>

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.593 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
<i>love affair and an intense</i>
<i>collaboration, producing scores</i>
<i>of seminal works, challenging</i>

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.596 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
<i>attitudes towards gender and</i>
<i>identity.</i>

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.999 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: We are kneeling face
to face, pressing our mouths
together.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.136 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
Our noses are blocked with
filter tips.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Breathing in/Breathing Out
<i>was one of their most famous</i>
<i>works.</i>

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.309 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>The performance continued until</i>

<i>losing consciousness and could</i>

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
<i>no longer continue.</i>

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:19.452 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>In 1983, they devised a piece</i>
<i>to cement their union, where</i>
<i>they would walk the Great Wall</i>

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.623 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
<i>of China, beginning from</i>

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.191 align:start line:10% position:10% size:15%
<i>marry.</i>

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:29.295 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>But by the time the necessary</i>

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.331 align:start line:10% position:10% size:40%
<i>relationship had</i>
<i>disintegrated.</i>

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:36.202 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
<i>Instead, they decided to</i>
<i>undertake a spiritual journey</i>
<i>to end their partnership,</i>

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:41.641 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
<i>turning even their break-up</i>
<i>into a piece of performance</i>
<i>art.</i>

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
<i>Called The Lovers: The Great</i>
Wall Walk,<i> it was a work of</i>
<i>operatic proportions.</i>

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:55.521 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>On 30th of March, 1988,</i>
<i>Abramovic set out from the Old</i>
<i>Dragon's Head where the eastern</i>

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:58.357 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>end of the Great Wall meets the</i>
<i>Yellow Sea.</i>

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:03.396 align:end line:74% position:88% size:78%
<i>On the same day, Ulay began his</i>

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.731 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
<i>Gobi Desert.</i>

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:08.634 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: I climbed the
Dragon's Back.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
I can feel his spine, his
bloodstream pulsing under my
feet.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:19.979 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt;<i> For three months, they walked</i>

<i>finally met, embracing before</i>

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.948 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
<i>parting ways forever.</i>

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:27.987 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: It is more dramatic,
more like a film ending than
actually having this romantic

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.056 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
story of two lovers.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.627 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> After this, Abramovic chose</i>
<i>to work alone.</i>

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:39.899 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>Her art would become more</i>
<i>theatrical and would demand</i>
<i>ever more from her audience.</i>

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.538 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>Marina Abramovic is considered</i>
<i>the grand dame of performance</i>
<i>art.</i>

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:50.743 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>Born in Belgrade, she pushes</i>
<i>the boundaries of both body and</i>
<i>mind, exploring themes of</i>

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.212 align:start line:79% position:10% size:45%
<i>violence, love and</i>
<i>spirituality.</i>

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:59.685 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I think I was born like this
because as soon as I had a
pencil and paper and paint, I

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
was painting all over my house.

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.623 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
There was no white wall left.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:12.965 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Much later, I remember very much
lying on the grass in a field
and looking up, and then, I see

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:17.603 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
out of nowhere, like, 13
military planes crossing the
sky.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.806 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
So, they make these lines, you
know?

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:23.876 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
And I look these lines in a
maze; it was so beautiful and
abstract.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:28.347 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And then, after a while, the
lines disappear and it was just
blue sky, and I felt that that

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.116 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
was some kind of revelation.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:35.154 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
I remember standing up, saying
to myself, "But this is crazy.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:39.425 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
Why should I do something
two-dimensional when I can do
anything I want?"

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:46.566 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
So, I immediately went to this
military base and I ask there if
I can have 12 planes to make a

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.934 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
drawing.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.937 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
And they called my father and
said, "Your daughter's
completely crazy.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:55.575 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
You know how much it cost for
her to fly, you know, 12
military planes for drawings in

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.809 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
the sky?

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.311 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
Get her out of here."

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:03.883 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
I like to tell you the story
how we in Balkan kill the rats.

&gt;&gt;<i> In 1997, at the Venice</i>

&gt;&gt; The work was in the Italian
Pavilion-- which, if you go to
Venice, there's lots of little

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.873 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
pavilions with artists
working, this pavilion has
hundreds of artists working.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.976 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
So, it's very easy for a piece
to get overlooked.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.144 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
The smell hit you first.

(Singing in foreign language)
&gt;&gt; LOUISA: And there she was in
this dark space, sitting on this

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.622 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
huge pile of increasingly smelly
cow bones.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:48.661 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; In white clothes, covered in
blood, scrubbing with a wire
brush on these bones, singing a

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:49.896 align:start line:10% position:10% size:18%
lament.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:54.901 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Trying to atone for the
atrocities that were taking
place just across the water.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:09:00.339 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
Literally, you had the war
unfolding, the conflict within
iron earshot almost to Venice.

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:07.213 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; And this piece was so
important to me because this was
metaphor for the Balkan War.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:14.086 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And she's talked about
cleansing the conscience, as if
cleaning the bones, she could

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:17.123 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
clean away what happened.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:24.030 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Wow, it was difficult to do
it because it was the hottest
day in Venice, you know, 30

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:29.068 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
degree, the worms were coming
out of the bones, and I was
doing this six days, six hours

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.137 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
every single day.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:36.442 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I doubt anybody's put
themselves through what she has
done to explore the human

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.878 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
condition in the name of art.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:46.085 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
You take many of the great
western artists, and it's that
unflinchingly direct way with

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:52.858 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
which they engage with human
brutality and mortality that
draws us to them.

00:09:53.859 --> 00:10:02.234 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Our life on this planet is so
incredibly difficult and there's
so much pain, and what is my

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.936 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
responsibility an artist?

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:08.741 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I'm not politician, but what I
can do on my own to change
something or to change

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.343 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
consciousness?

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:24.323 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
First 30 years, you know, very
difficult life to get to that
point.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.528 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
You know, only after 50, I could
pay my telephone and electricity
bills.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:31.063 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
I live in the car.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.899 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
And it was worth it, every
single moment, you know?

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.602 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
Nothing comes easy.

&gt;&gt;<i> In 2010, MoMA in New York</i>

<i>performance art in its history.</i>

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:49.415 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I remember the curator, he
said to me, "I would like to
call this<i> The Artist Is Present</i>

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.885 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%

where you are present in the

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
piece."

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.590 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And when he said that, you know,
he gave me idea of the
performance.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:02.428 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I said, "Well, then, I have to
be present in the space also for
the duration of the show."

&gt;&gt;<i> For three months, six days a</i>

<i>to sit opposite her and look</i>

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; If you sat opposite anybody
and stared into their eyes,
that's an incredibly powerful

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:22.748 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
thing.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:28.354 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
But to stare into her eyes,
they're like deep wells of
history, of identity, of

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:33.559 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
melancholy, that it almost
throws that back at you and it
makes you look inside yourself.

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.761 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: This chair in front
of me was never empty.

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:40.132 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
There was constantly amount of
people need to have this
experience.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:44.603 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And you sit there and you're
observed by me, but you're also
observed by the public and

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.939 align:start line:79% position:10% size:55%
you're also filmed and
photographed.

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:52.078 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
So, you're nowhere to escape,
except into yourself, and the
moment you get into yourself,

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:55.614 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
then all this, you know,
emotions come out.

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:58.684 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
It was like a volcano of
emotions to the public.

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:08.961 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; LOUISA: To be sitting every
day in a chair without going,
leaving, eating, peeing,

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.463 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
anything is huge.

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.465 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
I mean, she had to go into
training for that.

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:15.468 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I mean, I can't sit still for
ten minutes without doing
anything.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:16.469 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
Who can?

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:19.004 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
To be able to sit there and just
look and be...

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:22.875 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; It was like a NASA program
for the space, going to space.

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:26.479 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
I had to re-construct my own
system, physical.

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:30.950 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I never eat lunch because, you
know, if I do this during all
day, eight hours and ten hours

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:37.022 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
on Fridays, that means that, you
know, lunchtime that your body
produce acids to digest, so that

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:41.327 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
can create headaches, very
unpleasant feelings if you don't
eat.

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:43.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
So, I didn't have lunch for one
year.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:47.166 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I also understood that, in the
performance, how little you
need.

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.801 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
You need actually nothing.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:57.209 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
You just need to be there, 100%,
with yourself and projecting
that energy to the viewer.

00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:00.613 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
I come out of that chair and I
was not the same anymore.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.615 align:start line:79% position:10% size:55%
The transformation was
incredible.

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:04.350 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
Something really happened.

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
I understood the need of public
today not to look at something
but be part of something, and I

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:18.931 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
understood that our life is so
fast that we have to make our
art slower and slower.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.173 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> It took four years for</i>

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.782 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It was actually an exhibition
where she did not prepare a
script.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:40.152 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
There wasn't this idea of a
masterplan, which is
interesting.

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:42.221 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
She developed it all on the way.

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:49.094 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And, you know, you're coming
to London, you're coming to the
place, you know, Damien Hirst

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:53.999 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
made the diamond skull-- which
is really a huge comment on the
art as being commodity.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:58.504 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And I was thinking, let's see
the other angle, let's see
something from emptiness, let's

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.573 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
see something from nothing.

00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:06.845 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; All the materials that Marina
used were her own body and a few
props, and there she was in the

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.481 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
Serpentine every day, ten till
six.

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:12.618 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
People arrived, they literally
left their baggage--
psychological and literally at

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.619 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
the door.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
You checked in your watch, your
mobile phone, all your bags.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:19.558 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It was very much ritual
because we would really give her
the key.

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:25.764 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
She would open then
ceremonially, at 10 o'clock, the
space, let people in, salute

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:29.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
them, greet them, welcome them,
as a ritual.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:33.806 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; And in you went, and then,
whatever happened, happened.

00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:38.377 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Visitors were taken by the</i>

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
&gt;&gt; It was a very strange
experience.

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:50.923 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
It's something we haven't really
experienced since our childhood,
that someone would, you know,

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.692 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
put you to bed.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:56.161 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Because we don't do this in
our own real life.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
I mean, nobody sit at home in a
chair and do nothing.

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.266 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
They will always do something.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:04.837 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
We always want to get
information in our system-- you
know, look at the telephones,

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:09.708 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
get television, get the news,
you know, read newspaper.

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:14.446 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
But here is about emptying
yourself, is about giving out,
out, out.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.516 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
There's not much happening.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.618 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
You're not achieving anything.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:22.121 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
You're just in the presence of
here and now.

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:26.725 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
So, with the public, you have to
connect the public with the
performer with that moment of

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:27.726 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
here and now.

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
There is no past, which already
happened.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:30.729 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
Future didn't happen.

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:33.365 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
Nothing exists, just life
itself.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.668 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
And that is the key.

&gt;&gt;<i> Having won over a sceptical</i>

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:57.256 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%

00:15:57.323 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:04.229 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: And they put the
headphones, way to block the
sound.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:08.567 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
That headphones to block the
sound is a pretty good
invention, I have to say.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:15.507 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
The headphones make you aware of
your heartbeat, which is
interesting about that is you

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:19.244 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
are together with the people,
but also alone in the same time.

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
But you kind of have collective
energy who helps you to get into
that state.

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:29.321 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; TIM: It's a loss of a sense
of self.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:34.393 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
Paradoxically, a total
engagement with the self.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.664 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; LOUISA: It's all rather more
kind of calm and sedate, in a
way, a journey of discovery for

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
the audience, as well as for
Abramovic herself.

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:44.737 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
All the things that she
espouses, really, have a lot to
do with Buddhism, have a lot to

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:45.904 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
do with mindfulness.

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:49.274 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
You know, she taps into a very
broad spectrum, and I think
people are hungry for that,

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.343 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
particularly young people.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:58.350 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: I feel that it is
right time because amount of
young people participating.

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:01.487 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
You know, my public is extremely
young.

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.555 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
I have people from 14 years old.

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:10.028 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; LOUISA: There's several
reasons, I think, why she's so
popular with young audiences.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:14.833 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I think we do live in a very
participatory, self-regarding
world-- you know, all of taking

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.671 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
selfies, everything's on the
phone, everything's kind of
instantaneous and constantly

00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:22.074 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
performing for various cameras
and screens.

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:26.745 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
On the other hand, we live in a
very dematerialized world, where
everything is virtual-- you

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:30.949 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
know, friendships, romances are
all conducted on Facebook,
social media or whatever.

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:35.821 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
Abramovic is very much about,
you know, the simple here and
now, and I think, you know,

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.690 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
people crave that.

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:43.028 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Marina Abramovic is known as</i>
<i>the "Godmother of Performance</i>
<i>Art."</i>

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:48.267 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
<i>Now approaching her 70th</i>

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.235 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:54.940 align:end line:74% position:88% size:78%
<i>Her current project is based at</i>
<i>the Benaki Museum in Athens,</i>
<i>showcasing young Greek</i>

00:17:55.007 --> 00:18:00.412 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>performance artists, at a time</i>
<i>when public funding for art</i>
<i>has been drastically cut.</i>

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:07.186 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; I'm elated by the fact that
Marina Abramovic not only is
here, but is here with full

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:14.827 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
commitment and great love for
what she's doing here in Greece,
with a deep realization of the

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:22.668 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
environment and the psyche of
the Greek people in these times
of difficulty.

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:26.805 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I'm not surprised when
somebody says, "Ooh, you know,
down there in Greece, you can't

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:30.576 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
pay your own salaries or
pensions, do you have time for
art?"

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:36.582 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
It's like there's plenty of
people flying from all over
Europe right now to visit the

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:37.683 align:start line:10% position:10% size:13%
show.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.117 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
Culture is not a luxury.

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:41.186 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
Culture is an economic force.

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:49.361 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt;<i> Encompassing performance,</i>
<i>lectures, screenings and</i>
<i>workshops, the show is an</i>

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:54.733 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
<i>opportunity for Abramovic to</i>
<i>pass on her hard-won wisdom to</i>
<i>her students and audience</i>

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.901 align:start line:10% position:10% size:15%
<i>alike.</i>

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:59.872 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt; One thing that is very
important is to train young
performer.

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.874 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
Is not just everybody can
perform.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
Is the same like a, you know,
you wanted to play Beethoven on
the piano, you can have a very

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:14.386 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
lousy piano player or you can
have the one who transcendents
you completely in an incredible

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:15.420 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
experience.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.788 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
So, same with performer.

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:20.025 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
That energy with performer put
the piece, his own personal
thing, this will make piece

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.094 align:start line:10% position:10% size:30%
good or not.

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:29.535 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Abramovic has been a pioneer</i>
<i>of re-performance-- allowing</i>
<i>younger artists to stage her</i>

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:35.073 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>iconic works, bringing them to</i>
<i>fresh audiences decades after</i>
<i>their original conception.</i>

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:42.047 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; I don't give permission for
the pieces who endanger the
life, which, I think, I was

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:45.651 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
responsible for my own life, but
I don't want to be responsible
for somebody else.

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:47.653 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
So, these, I do not give
permission.

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But for any other pieces, I do.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.092 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
Sometimes, I don't recognize my
piece re-performed.

00:19:54.159 --> 00:20:00.065 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
But still, this artist gives
something new and beautiful, an
element, and I have to agree,

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.733 align:start line:10% position:10% size:23%
you know?

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.471 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Artist must be beautiful.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:09.241 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
Art must be beautiful.

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:11.276 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
Artist must be beautiful.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.215 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to imitate
Marina's performance or, you
know, to reproduce exactly what

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.650 align:start line:10% position:10% size:35%
she was doing.

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:24.556 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
And, I think, this is the most
important thing-- you know, to
take the shape and the idea of

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:32.030 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
an already existing work and
trying to put your own
experiences in the work.

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:34.866 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
It's a challenge, but it's a--
yeah, it's a good challenge.

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.935 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
(Speaking foreign language)

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:41.607 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; There's just the simple idea
of the piece was to have metal
comb and metal brush in your

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:46.411 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
hands and you brush the hair
very violently, repeating
constantly "Art must be

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:49.881 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
beautiful, artist must be
beautiful," until you're
actually giving completely

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:53.852 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
different expression because
your face is kind of damaged,
the hair is damaged and doesn't

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.588 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
look, you know, that good
anymore.

00:20:56.655 --> 00:21:02.728 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I do have a fear of how, you
know, it will be like when I do
it for two hours or even longer.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:08.066 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
I have to say that, you know,
this brushing is quite
vigorous.

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.801 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
You lose a lot of hair.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:16.341 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It's not that you become ugly,
but there is this idea of
destroying your beauty or

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.143 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
however you want to call that.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.878 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
Artist must be beautiful.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.014 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: And I don't think art
have to be beautiful.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.015 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
Art have to be disturbing.

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.550 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
Art have to, you know, ask right
questions.

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:26.918 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
Art have to predict future.

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.587 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
So, not just beauty.

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:31.556 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
So, this was the idea in those
days of that work.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:36.128 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And then, work becomes some kind
of classic now that people are
performing.

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
It's important to be
re-performed because it's living
form of art.

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:44.903 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
That's the only way that this
work can survive.

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:49.508 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; LOUISA: She's always very
generous to other artists, I
think.

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
You know, she's very much the
great grand dame herself, but
also she spends a lot of time

00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:55.614 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
with younger artists.

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:59.551 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
People can say, "Ooh, they're
acolytes just kind of forming
their own image."

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.553 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
But I think, actually, it's more
than that.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.691 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I think she is really passing on
these skills and these ways of
being able to kind of interact

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:08.860 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
with audiences and, indeed,
interact with yourself.

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:18.070 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; MARINA: Doesn't matter what
you leave behind in material
wealth.

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:21.106 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
It's really important what
people remember for, you know?

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:26.878 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
To me, it's all about
performance and it's all about
that kind of legacy.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
&gt;&gt; She's nearly 70.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:32.551 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Everyone thought that<i> The Artist</i>
<i>Is Present</i> at MoMA would be the
last extreme performance she put

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:34.052 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
herself through.

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.121 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
I'd say watch this space.

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:41.193 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Wherever Marina Abramovic</i>
<i>goes from here, there will be</i>
<i>one last piece of performance</i>

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:43.228 align:start line:85% position:10% size:10%
<i>art.</i>

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; For my funeral, I have three
Marinas.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:46.431 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
There will be three coffins.

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:49.835 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
Nobody knows which is real one,
but there are three of them,
placed in three different places

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:53.872 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
where I lived the longest--
which will be Belgrade,
Amsterdam and New York.

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:58.677 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
These three Marinas, you know,
I think, the one is, like, very
heroic and have courage and go

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:01.313 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
for it.

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:06.051 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
And another one is pretty
spiritual.

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:11.590 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And the third one is really full
of bullshit life-- too much
chocolate and kind of vanity and

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.525 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
love fashion and all the rest.

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:18.497 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
And I think all three somehow--
you know, I was always ashamed
of one of them.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:26.371 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
And now, I figure out that it's
the best thing is that actually
you accept them, which I did.
