00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.392 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
I find that interesting
because--
Especially for a younger artist,

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:38.898 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
because painting, of course, is
not considered a young man's

&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO: He's one
of that generation of Iranians
that were born in the '70s,

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:05.391 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
before the Revolution, lived
through the Revolution as a
child, and then the Iraq-Iran

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:12.065 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
War, before his family migrated,
like many families, from Iran to
either the United States or

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.333 align:start line:10% position:10% size:18%
Europe.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.370 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
But he was interested in being a
painter and an artist, and came
to New York and studied at the

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.439 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
School of Visual Arts.

&gt;&gt; ALI: Well, I started making
drawings when the Iran-Iraq War
was happening.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:26.246 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
I was making drawings based on
the sounds that I was hearing.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:30.283 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
'Cause you know, you would--
(Sighing)
When the alarm would come on,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.954 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
you would run down to the
basement, and then all that you
were left with was these sounds

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.122 align:start line:10% position:10% size:38%
and vibrations.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:43.997 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
And I made drawings based on
these sounds to try to sort of
understand what was happening

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:50.036 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
around me, and it was, I guess,
my way of dealing with the whole
situation.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.105 align:start line:10% position:10% size:40%
(Seagull crying)

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:58.511 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
I think the breakthrough moment
was when, at graduate school, I
had to do my thesis.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:04.150 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And I got a grant to go to
Normandy, and one of the things
that we did was to go to the

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.752 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
D-Day site.

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:11.691 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And I was sort of looking at the
scenery and, uh, it looked
really familiar to me and it

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:15.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
brought back a flash of memory.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:19.332 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
I could sort of smell, actually,
the war.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:24.337 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
It was so familiar that I was
sort of walking around in a
daze.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:31.711 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
So, when I came back from
Normandy, I decided to make
these charcoal drawings that

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:36.015 align:start line:79% position:10% size:58%
were based on sounds of
explosions.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:43.289 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I felt like something happened
there, where I felt freed from
trying to make paintings.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:50.964 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I was able to compose the work
the way I'd been wanting to,
without strategizing so much.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
It really showed me a different
way of sort of working.

&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:<i> This painting,</i>
<i>called</i> Blackwater,<i> refers to</i>

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.251 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:22.862 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN: Whether or not
they're violent, I think, is
open to question if you're

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.964 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
looking at a scene of warfare.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:29.235 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And to that extent, they might
be related to the work of
Hieronymus Bosch, which often

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:33.973 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
includes scenes of great kind of
barbarity.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:41.914 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ALI: When I look at
Hieronymus Bosch's painting, it
still sort of speaks to what's

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.650 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
happening in our time now.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:48.821 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
It's lived through time, and you
look at the work and you can see
those characters living now,

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.890 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
with different outfits now.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
I'm really intrigued by the way
he was able to portray society
in his time, but still have it

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:03.102 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
live through time and be
relevant to our time.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:08.941 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>The Garden of Earthly Delights</i>
at the Prado must be my
favourite painting.

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:13.746 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I could just go stand in front
of it for hours and hours, and
what I love about it is that

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.283 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
there are stories within stories
within stories.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.688 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And you could sort of--
Your eyes just wanders around,
and there's just so much to take

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.056 align:start line:85% position:10% size:08%
in.

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:25.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And it's an experience, really.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:29.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
It's not something that you can
just walk away from.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:40.773 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I mean, Bosch's paintings, the
way it has a bird's-eye view of
the world, is what intrigues me.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.311 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
Seeing it from a bird's-eye
point of view, kind of having an
overall look, a macro level of

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:51.117 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
society, and I think in that
way, that's what I try to do in
my work as well: sort of, like,

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:57.657 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
pull back and look at our
society from, like, a bird's-eye
perspective.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:35.762 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; As with many of his works, it
consists of vigorous
brushstrokes, small flakes and

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:40.166 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
squiggles, and it's really about
the brushstroke.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:46.372 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
Sort of expressions of the
horrific sounds, actually, of
war.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:53.045 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
There's an atmosphere of gloom
that surrounds this painting, of
despair, and I think it's a

00:06:53.112 --> 00:07:00.920 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
commentary also on, you know,
what is going on today in our
part of the world.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:06.325 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ALI: I mean, the Metropolitan
is the museum that I go to the
most out of every other museum.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.794 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
It's like my second home.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.797 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
I go there at least once or
twice a month.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:17.170 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
So, to be in this collection
among all these artists that I
go and look at to learn

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:20.606 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
something from is pretty
incredible.

<i>century, and especially those</i>
<i>of an artist known as Behzad.</i>

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:41.527 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; ALI: I mean, with Behzad,
like, the faces had their own
sort of personality and

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:46.632 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
character; where some of the
Persian miniature paintings, one
face could be every face.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:50.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
He kind of gave it a little bit
of a twist.

&gt;&gt; MARYAM: From a 16th-century
royal manuscript called the

00:07:55.741 --> 00:08:00.913 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp,</i>
which is perhaps the greatest
illustrated Persian manuscript

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.348 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
ever produced.

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:08.955 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And I think the battle paintings
were inspirational to Ali
Banisadr's work.

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:16.696 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; ALI: I do see myself in the
tradition, but I think for me,
what's important is to try to

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
understand the essence of the
Persian miniature paintings.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:28.641 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
Like, its essence as opposed to
trying to use the motifs and the
figures and sort of make them

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.009 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
abstract, you know?

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.844 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
You see a lot of that happening.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:37.116 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
So, in a way, I do see myself as
part of the tradition of Persian
miniature, but I'm not making

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.285 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Persian miniature paintings.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:43.155 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I see Ali as a Brooklyn
artist, which is where he lives
and works.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
And you know, where I'm sure he
feels at home.

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:50.529 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And the extent to which he draws
on references from the past and
the present I'm sure connects in

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:56.869 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
some way to the Islamic Republic
of Iran, but the extent to which
he should or could be seen as an

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:01.974 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
Islamic artist seems almost
irrelevant, I think, for the

think is the asset.

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:39.572 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It's nice to be able to listen
to music and have this sort of
parallel visual world that's

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
going at the same time.

quietly and then it just sort of
erupts, which is--

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:06.432 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
I guess I could relate to that
in a way, the way I paint.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:14.907 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I mean, the energy just shoots
up, and then it just sort of,
kind of, uh, calms down, and

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.742 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
then it goes up again.

synaesthesia, and he's had it
since he was a child.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:38.798 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
He talks about the Iran-Iraq

splintering sound of bombs

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:44.737 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
coming, I think, you know, has
made a huge psychological

not making a soundtrack painting
or anything like that.

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:56.215 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
The sound that I'm talking
about, it comes from the
painting itself.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:58.150 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
But it has to be exciting to me.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:02.755 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
It has to be surprising to me,
or else there's no point.

Ali's work, and that rhythm is,

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.737 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
I think, contemporary.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:58.344 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%

than, um, fluid--
I mean in his brushwork.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.982 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
And yet of course, you know, he
seems to be, like, revelling in
his paints, and he takes it into

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:07.052 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
a--
I think a very exciting realm.

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:33.879 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
Things are--
It's like in opera, where the
sound just goes up, and I think

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:36.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
that's sort of what's happening
at the top.

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:41.854 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
Like, as you go the higher
level, it transforms into
another element.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:46.392 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
It becomes something else, like
the "Ascending Bird," that
music.

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:52.131 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
Or even particularly, like that
painting over there, I mean, all
those figures are transforming

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.200 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
into ether.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:05.911 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Most of my paintings, the bottom
side is where all the kind of
chaos, and where all the

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:09.782 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
figures, animals, gods,
machines, everything is.

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:16.088 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And as it lifts up, the painting
becomes lighter and there's some
kind of a hope.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:22.294 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

into, like, another element,

way, to listen to that sound,
seems much more important to me
as a viewer than to actually

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.812 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
decode the visual imagery.

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:48.687 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
&gt;&gt; They're quiet.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:56.295 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
(Chuckling)
They're finished when they're
quiet and they're not asking for

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
anything more, and they're fine
exactly how they are.

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:05.871 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
And usually what I do is I turn
away a painting for, like, a
month or something and then come

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:09.842 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
in one day and quickly turn it
around and look at it, and if
it's--

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:13.379 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
Nothing jumps out at me, then
it's fine.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:17.149 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
If there's always, you know, if
there's a part that jumps out at
me, I'm going to have to deal

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:19.885 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
with it, even though it could be
the best part of the painting.

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:25.357 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
Maybe I have to destroy it for
the whole thing to function,
really.

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:31.897 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
You look around, and it's like
looking at, like, little worlds
there, with little people going

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.432 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
about their daily lives.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
Sort of like Bruegel paintings,
where you have this bird's-eye
view and you're just creating

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:43.342 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
narrative for these little
figures that are just going
about their daily lives.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.411 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
It's kind of fun.

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:50.282 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN: Brooklyn is the
most creative borough in New
York.

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.318 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
And New York is made up of five
boroughs.

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:56.922 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
The most well known, of course,
is Manhattan, which is the
origin of the art world past.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
But the cost of living in the
centre of New York and in
particular Manhattan has become

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:02.661 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
prohibitive for most artists.

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:07.132 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
So, younger artists have
colonized sections of Brooklyn
and Queens in order to find

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.803 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
cheap living but also, large
working spaces.

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:15.507 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
And so, the bulk of artists,
even successful ones, tend to be
operating and working in

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.576 align:start line:10% position:10% size:23%
Brooklyn.

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:24.283 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; When I came to New York, as I
walked around I felt like if I
could call anywhere home, this

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.617 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
is it.

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:31.924 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I don't feel displaced here,
really, because of diversity and
because of the type of people

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.525 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
that live here.

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:35.894 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
You have the best of both
worlds, really.

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.597 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
I mean, you could go to the
museums as you like.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.032 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
It's very close.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:46.338 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
But then you could sort of get
away from everything, too, and
come up here and sort of cleanse

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:50.609 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
your palette after hours of
painting.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:58.817 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
I've been actually watching the
sunset every evening, looking at
the colours, and somehow these

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:02.121 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
colours have worked their way
into my paintings.

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:10.863 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
This sort of pinkish colour came
about from the sunset.

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:18.270 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
But the mood, certainly, for me,
more so than before reflects my
surrounding workspace.

00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:24.243 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; JEFFREY: It's always
fascinating to see how an artist
adapts to his or her

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:27.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
surroundings and how it affects
the work.

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:34.486 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
The works from a few years ago
seemed to come mainly out of his
own imagination.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:40.492 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
The current work, though, is
much more rooted in the reality
of his neighbourhood.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:46.498 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
You can see the inspiration of
the roll-down gates, the street
characters of the Brooklyn

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.567 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
light.

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:54.940 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Ali literally does walk the</i>
<i>streets, gathering inspiration,</i>
<i>and the things that catch his</i>

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.009 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
<i>eye are often surprising.</i>

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:06.351 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; This line element, this sort
of motif, I think I see a lot of
shutters walking around.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:11.723 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
And I thought, you know, that's
kind of an interesting element
to use.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:18.664 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
Like, it separates the space
behind from what comes forward,
and I always liked this sort of

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:24.102 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
element of having deep space
fight with flatness.

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:35.447 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
Perhaps someone could rent a
room there.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:42.688 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
(Laughing)
It's nice how there's, like,
rust and grey and a lighter grey

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.923 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
and a yellow.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:51.730 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
One of the things that lately
I've been paying attention to is
the sort of weathered look, and

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:57.569 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
kind of making mental notes of
how I could use these in my
painting.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:58.804 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
Yeah.

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:02.875 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
You have, like, a juxtaposition
of, like, gritty and nature.

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:05.511 align:start line:79% position:10% size:28%
(Chuckling)
Hello?

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.212 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
I love your garden.

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:11.416 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
You know, walking around
Brooklyn, you feel the sense of
creative energy around and you

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start line:79% position:10% size:45%
meet people in the
neighbourhood.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:20.425 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; LILLY: He started out as a
graffiti artist, met groups of
other graffiti artists, and he

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
found that really exhilarating.

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.232 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
&gt;&gt; You got to get this.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:31.837 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
At the beginning, America, it
was really hard for me to adjust
in a school that, you know,

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:36.341 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
getting the best grades wouldn't
necessarily make you popular.

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:38.043 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
Which in Iran, it did, you know?

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.847 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
That's--
(Chuckling)
You had to sort of adjust to a

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:47.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
different understanding of what
it is to be in America.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:50.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
(Siren wailing in the distance)
What is Brooklyn Bazaar?

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:54.927 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt;<i> On the corner, Ali happens to</i>
<i>run into Bazaar Royale, a</i>
<i>graffiti artist and local</i>

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:58.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
<i>organizer who has a mission to</i>
<i>bring art to the streets.</i>

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:04.536 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Usually, when you get a mural
with your face on it, you're
dead, and I'm very much alive

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:05.737 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
and well.

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.739 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
So, this is the freehand
paintbrush.

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:08.740 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:09.741 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
Okay.

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:10.742 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
Got it.

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:15.647 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; It's better for me to put
these things up over the
neighbourhood, since the

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:19.117 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
development of Brooklyn is
growing and the demand is so
high.

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:20.218 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:24.423 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And rather than look at
boarded things, I'd rather, you
know, look at art.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.424 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.426 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; And ensure other people do,
too.

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:28.427 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:33.165 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Because, you know, if you
look, they'll write over
everything other than the art.

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.433 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.735 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
That's good that they respect
that, you know?

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.804 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
Yeah.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:46.211 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> While Ali isn't involved in</i>
<i>street art anymore, it's not</i>
<i>hard to see its traces in his</i>

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:47.613 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
<i>work.</i>

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:52.451 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
<i>This painting is from 2008,</i>
<i>where graffiti art seems to</i>
<i>confront the Persian</i>

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.519 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
<i>miniatures.</i>

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.825 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
<i>Many artists make sketches in</i>
<i>preparation for their big</i>
<i>paintings.</i>

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:02.527 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>Ali is turning that idea on its</i>
<i>head.</i>

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:07.065 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>He's making charcoal drawings,</i>
<i>some of them quite</i>
<i>graffiti-like, derived from</i>

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:10.035 align:start line:79% position:10% size:58%
<i>parts of his bigger oil</i>
<i>paintings.</i>

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:14.106 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
<i>This painting is taken from a</i>
<i>section of the painting with</i>
<i>sunset pinks that he's just</i>

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.174 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
<i>finished working on.</i>

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:26.151 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Here is the section where I
wanted to capture in the drawing
the little children of the

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
painting, and then they sort of
grow up and find their own way.

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:39.031 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
&gt;&gt; JEFFREY: Ali is also a
painter with exceptional
technique.

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:43.301 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
This like a studio in Paris in
the 1920s.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:51.977 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
It's not just the high ceilings
and the balcony; it's the way
the paints are all arrayed.

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:55.647 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
He's a classic oil painter.

00:21:55.714 --> 00:22:00.986 align:start line:10% position:10% size:58%
He has mastered these
century-old techniques.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:09.695 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
But then, of course, he's one
who is very well aware of the
world of digital imagery and

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.763 align:start line:10% position:10% size:43%
film, television.

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:17.302 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> This is one of Ali's</i>
<i>paintings inspired by cinema.</i>

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:21.073 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
<i>It's called</i> Ran,<i> after the</i>
<i>Japanese epic film by Kurosawa.</i>

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.912 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; LILLY: This is Kurosawa's
masterpiece.

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.081 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
You know, with all the soldiers
running around.

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:34.052 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
So, he kind of looks at the film
and sees how he can turn that
into a painting: like, the way

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.922 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
they use colour, the way they
crop, the way they use light.

00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:38.990 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
You know, all of that.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:44.062 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
His colours are rather
denatured.

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.264 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
They're not natural colours.

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.666 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
Very noisy colours.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:52.237 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
They're noisy, shrill, but
they're also beautiful.

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:57.209 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
&gt;&gt; ALI: There's been some
criticism about my colour
palette.

00:22:57.275 --> 00:23:02.848 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
But I think there's always been
this bias against colour in
Western history, where they

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:07.119 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
would think it's primitive or
Eastern.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:12.457 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
(Chuckling)
For me, using these colours is a
way of capturing, like, that

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:18.330 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
intensity that you get after
it's rained, and you walk around
and everything is sort of, like,

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:19.598 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
so intense.

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:23.869 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
I think these colours exist in
nature and they exist in your
imagination, so why can't they

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.937 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
be painted?

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:36.948 align:start line:85% position:10% size:03%
