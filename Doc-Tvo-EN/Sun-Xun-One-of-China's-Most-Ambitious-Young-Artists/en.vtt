<i>While he did not live through</i>

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:06.532 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Sun Xun is an artist who's
deeply interested in kind of the
drama of the way history

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.601 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
unfolds and how it gets written.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:15.141 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
So I think he's found a way
through animation to, you know,
to tell stories that are really

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
fables about very archetypical,
uh, characters.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:24.217 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
And I think that the people find
that quite appealing.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:38.891 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I think the main message he's
trying to "convene" with his
work is how to navigate certain

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.729 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
aspects of Chinese society which
are extremely traditional versus
certain aspects of Chinese

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.965 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
society when are extremely
modern.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:51.771 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
And there's always going to be a
gap between those two worlds and
his work falls within that gap.

<i>Singaporean Print Institute,</i>

<i>Singapore's autocratic</i>

<i>political system.</i>

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:03.189 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:12.298 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%

<i>national symbol, the Merlion.</i>

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:30.449 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; So the project that he did
with us, um, he created a
country within Singapore, and

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:37.356 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
this is-- even though it was a
response to him to being in
Singapore during that project,

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:42.695 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
it is really kind of much
broader sense a country's
governed by a person who tells

00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:45.464 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
the truth, but is it really the
truth?

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:51.770 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%

what is really the truth and

what are they talking about?

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:59.645 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
So I think in this manner, every
project that he does that has
kind of a political underlying

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:05.284 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
theme has something of the truth

<i>he's held over a hundred group</i>
<i>and solo exhibitions worldwide.</i>

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:39.885 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; His career's also interesting
on the level of artists kind of
looking for, um, alternatives to

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:43.989 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
the traditional, commercial
system.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:49.995 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
Um, where one produces sort of
unique objects for very high
level consumption by a very

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:55.367 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
rarified group of collectors
through, you know, mechanisms
like the gallery.

00:18:55.434 --> 00:19:02.774 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
So I think there's a real desire
on his part to kind of shape not
just the works but kind of the

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:09.214 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
terms and the apparatus of
circulation for those works.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:19.358 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> But for Sun Xun, each new</i>
<i>work and each new exhibition is</i>
<i>also a conscious addition to</i>

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:22.661 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
<i>his growing collection of</i>
<i>personal achievements.</i>

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:03.702 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I think every artist has some
kind of ambitions, wherein to
which degree, I mean everybody--

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:04.803 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
it differs.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:10.342 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
So, but somebody like Sun Xun,
he has done so many solo shows
and he's participated in so many

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:15.213 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
international festivals and I
think in such a short span of
time, it's kind of a testament

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:22.254 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
to the fact that he's really
full of creativity and he's
really full of energy.

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:26.792 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
He can create works that are
really amazing nonstop.

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:33.865 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> NARRATOR: Unsurprisingly, in</i>
<i>addition to his 3D film, Sun</i>
<i>Xun is also working on another</i>

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:35.767 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
<i>exhibition at the same time.</i>

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:39.471 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
<i>This second one is for the</i>
<i>Guggenheim.</i>

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:44.576 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>Here he is at his friend Gong</i>
<i>Bin's paper studio, where they</i>
<i>are making unique pieces of</i>

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:48.046 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
<i>paper specially for Sun Xun's</i>
<i>work.</i>

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:21.346 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Sun Xun and Gong Bin have</i>
<i>experimented with making new</i>
<i>types of papers for five years.</i>

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:27.152 align:end line:74% position:88% size:78%
<i>They are now hoping to find the</i>
<i>most suitable paper to work on</i>
<i>for the Guggenheim project.</i>

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:06.425 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Experimenting with different</i>
<i>types of paper is a process</i>
<i>that takes time.</i>

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:11.930 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>Sun Xun has a few more months</i>
<i>before his exhibition to aim at</i>
<i>perfection.</i>

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:54.973 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; He's definitely one of the
most active artists of his
generation.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.077 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
For Sun Xun, I think if he
didn't work, he would be so
unhappy.

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:05.417 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
I think he's ambitious to
create, I think he's ambitious
to make art, he's ambitious to

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:06.818 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
tell stories.

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:11.056 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And how that is delivered to the
rest of the world and to public,
I guess that is through the

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:14.126 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
exhibitions and projects that he
does.
