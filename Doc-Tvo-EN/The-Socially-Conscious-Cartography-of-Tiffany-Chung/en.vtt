just straightforward maps.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:42.375 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I would actually say they are
more of palimpsests because they
collapse different periods in

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:47.480 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

they collapse memories and

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:57.824 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
something that's so much more
profound, and I think that

serious engagement with complex

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.243 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%

remembered as an artist with an
enormous social conscience and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.849 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
someone who's really been able

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:39.158 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; The way she draws on her own

of empathy with other people's

experience, and it's not about
representing her own story.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:48.401 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%

gone through a similar period of
rice shortages-- or should I say

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.892 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
everything was shortage.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.861 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
We did not have enough rice.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.130 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
We did not have enough anything.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:58.605 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%

kome sodo just kind of brought
back, you know, the memories of

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.673 align:start line:10% position:10% size:58%
that period in Vietnam.

not know how else I could kind

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:37.744 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%

this playful element.

I went there in 2010 and what I
saw was really bizarre.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:42.808 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
I've seen people living in the
rubble.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.177 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
People demolished their own
houses.

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:46.846 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
It was really intense.

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:51.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
So, um, yeah, I couldn't really
follow the project.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.520 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
It was just too much.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:59.925 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
So, I came back in 2013, wanting
to know what was happening.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:05.531 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
And by that time, I saw no
people.

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:13.539 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> The people who once played</i>

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:35.094 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:44.537 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It's really quite dramatic if
you know the history of the
displacement and you know the

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:49.141 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
degree to which people are
already erasing that history.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.410 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
That's what archaeologists do,
right?

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%

road and excavate somebody
else's home.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:08.928 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%

a topographical legend of the

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:54.500 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:59.638 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
try to extract the data-- the
numbers, the figures,
statistics, everything.

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:05.677 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I have to check, like, ten
different sources for the
figures and trying to see which

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.579 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
figure is more realistic.

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:12.451 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
If there's more sources, use
that number versus the other
number.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:14.453 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
You know, it's a lot of work

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:06.204 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%

nowhere.

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:13.378 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%

say that this place or this

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:45.877 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
places in Syria, and I ended up
creating these kind of light
boxes.

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:54.052 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
With the wooden boxes, it's all
handcrafted, referring to the
Victorian keepsake boxes.

&gt;&gt;<i> Combining and overlaying a</i>

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.995 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
<i>simple.</i>

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.465 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; MAN:<i> The search is a thorough</i>

&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:<i> In her most recent</i>
<i>Vietnamese exodus project, she</i>
<i>studies the post 1975 exodus,</i>

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:20.445 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>the largest group of Vietnamese</i>
<i>refugees that left the country.</i>

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:24.549 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>The depth and scope of her work</i>
<i>surprises us once again.</i>

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:27.319 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; TIFFANY: Layers and layers
and so many different things.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:34.459 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
Like, one project covers policy
making, cover, like, living
conditions in asylum camps and

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:43.669 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
then covered the educational
aspect of trying to get the
young artists here to access to

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.737 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
that history.

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:47.839 align:start line:10% position:10% size:50%
They're really good.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:53.078 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
They've got zero history
knowledge, but they've got the
skills.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.981 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
So, how do you get them to learn
the history?

00:21:56.048 --> 00:22:01.553 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
You just give them photos and
say, "Render this into painting
for me."

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:17.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
<i>Her life and her art are about</i>

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:20.238 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt; TIFFANY: There's certain
limitation in art.

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:23.508 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
You can only take it so far.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:31.583 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
I really want to push it beyond
what people think art is and
really tap into the

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.352 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
international policy making.

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:43.028 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I just want to use my work and
my research to hopefully demand
some changes.

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:47.399 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; RUSSELL: She's an artist with
a very expansive vision, an
artist who can really work

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:53.371 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
effectively in so many media
and is able to grapple with
enormous subjects in a very

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:58.844 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
intelligent, very nuanced and
very subtle, I guess, way.

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:06.818 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; QUYNH: She is definitely
effecting a new generation of
Vietnamese artists, of just the

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:08.153 align:start line:10% position:10% size:53%
Vietnamese community.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.759 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
I mean, they're seeing that art
can really-- it can be more than
just beautiful.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:17.629 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; TIFFANY: My work, in a way,
is a quiet protest.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:24.603 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
It's a protest against the
politics of memory, the politics
of remembering and forgetting,

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:29.441 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
it's a protest against this
politically driven historical
amnesia.

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:38.316 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
And in order to do that-- you
know, it gives more of an impact
if you do it from within, if

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.485 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
that voice comes from within.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:52.464 align:start line:10% position:10% size:03%
