&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:<i> Kader Attia is one</i>
<i>of the most surprising and</i>
<i>provocative artists in the</i>

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.131 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
<i>world today.</i>

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:39.639 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>His socially and politically</i>
<i>charged work employs a wide</i>
<i>range of mediums to address</i>

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
<i>global issues surrounding</i>
<i>immigration, colonisation and</i>
<i>cultural identity.</i>

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: He's a global citizen
and I think his work reflects
the coming together of the

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.520 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Occidental and the Oriental.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:57.056 align:start line:74% position:10% size:60%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: He's very
interested in analogical
thinking.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:04.531 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
He allows the viewer to look at
two things and to create a
relationship between them.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:10.403 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; HANS: I think Kader Attia's
work has a lot to do with
engaging in a global dialogue.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.176 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: For him, I would say
art is a means to express
social, political, cultural

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.381 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
questions and they are never
just artistic questions.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.817 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt; ELLIOT: He's someone who
struggles.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:29.689 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
He pushes himself to actually
capture what he feels is wrong.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.097 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt; These moments in which I
developed interest in art,
I think was when I thought

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.468 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
it might be possible to change
the world.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:45.905 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I think art has this ability,
and that's why most of my
artworks are very interested in

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.042 align:start line:79% position:10% size:58%
these notions of living
together, politics.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.550 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> Politics underpins most of</i>
<i>Kader Attia work and his</i>
<i>installation, "Kasbah",</i>

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:03.623 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
<i>perfectly demonstrates the way</i>
<i>he playfully gets his audience</i>
<i>to consider issues of dominance</i>

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.427 align:start line:10% position:10% size:43%
<i>and exploitation.</i>

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:13.233 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; In North African cities, the
slums are called Kasbah, it's
like very provisional cities

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.604 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
made of any material found in
the street.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.708 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; He uses fragments of these
rooftops and, you know, brings
them into the gallery.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:26.212 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
That's a way of bringing the
city into the museum space.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:34.888 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; It's a huge semi-flat
expanse of corrugated iron and
old tires and bits of wood.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.626 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: It would be easy to
make a critical work about
living conditions of those

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:44.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
people, but Kader somehow turns
it around and gives it beauty.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:51.104 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ELLIOT: When you see people
in their stiletto heels or their
clumpy trainers, sort of trying

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.342 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
to keep their balance as they go
across the roofs, one of the
very clear things that you're

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.648 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
doing and a bit lost, I'd say on
quite a large proportion of the
visitors, is that you're

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:05.018 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
trading on the heads of the
poor.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:10.890 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> Born in France to Algerian</i>
<i>immigrants, Kader grew up both</i>
<i>Algiers and a largely North</i>

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
<i>African community on the</i>
<i>outskirts of Paris.</i>

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:18.164 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
<i>This duality would profoundly</i>
<i>influence his artistic outlook.</i>

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.606 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; This has helped me become
very sensitive to issues of
people in between spaces:

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.943 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
physical, geographical or
intellectual.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:35.815 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt;<i> After studying philosophy and</i>
<i>graphic design in Paris and</i>
<i>Barcelona, Kader spent two</i>

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.953 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
<i>years in the Congo to complete</i>
<i>his French National Service.</i>

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.323 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>It was an experience that would</i>
<i>further shape his worldview.</i>

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:52.699 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; From this I started to be
very interested by the problem
of colonization, this notion of

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:58.137 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
domination between one order of
things to another one, caught my
attention when I was living in

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.206 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
Congo.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:05.244 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Colonization would become an</i>
<i>important theme in Kader's</i>
<i>later work.</i>

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:10.416 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>But upon his return to Paris,</i>
<i>he stumbled on a far more</i>
<i>personal subject for his first</i>

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.486 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
<i>major project.</i>

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:18.424 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; KADER: I was walking in the
streets of Paris, I heard two
men talking each other in

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Arabic, but talking like women.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:28.735 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And so I turned myself and I saw
two transgenders and was like,
"Wow, those are real people and

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.470 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
they are very brave."

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:36.109 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
They were refugees from Algeria
in a time where Algeria was
almost taken over by the

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.110 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
Islamists.

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:41.347 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
So to be a man dressed as a
woman was not only dangerous,
I mean, there were really

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.416 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
killed.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:51.024 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Gaining their confidence,</i>
<i>Kader was introduced to a whole</i>
<i>community of transgendered</i>

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.362 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
<i>North Africans and made them</i>
<i>the subject of a photographic</i>
<i>series that he exhibited as a</i>

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.431 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
<i>slideshow in his home.</i>

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:08.975 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: It was less
documentary about this life than
making visible of dignity,

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:13.780 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
friendship, solidarity amongst
those people.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:19.285 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: They're somehow not
quite accepted in any society
and they live in often quite

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.220 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
impoverished circumstances.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:26.092 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
But they themselves are always
glamourous, and he, I think,
loved the way that they'd

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.829 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
reinvented themselves against
the odds.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.304 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; ELLIOT: There's a certain
beauty in those that are
wounded and really finding

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:41.541 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
themselves up against implacable
strength.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:46.012 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; The way of like, a sort of
incarnation that you can be
transgression politically

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.081 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
without being in politics.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:55.121 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> The work was a success and</i>

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.591 align:end line:79% position:88% size:78%
<i>Kader into the heart of the art</i>
<i>world.</i>

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:02.829 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; In the Venice Biennale it was
very well received and I was
very surprised because it was

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:08.634 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
not art for me, it was just we
saw the necessity of giving them
a voice and giving them a

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.369 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
visibility.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:15.007 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
I never thought this could
interest sort of artistic
audience.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:30.356 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Drawing on his connections</i>
<i>with North</i> Africa, French
<i>Algerian activist, Kader Attia,</i>

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:35.061 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
<i>shifted his gaze from the</i>
<i>personal lives of immigrant</i>
<i>communities in France and began</i>

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:40.366 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
<i>to explore broader issues</i>
<i>surrounding colonization,</i>

&gt;&gt; KADER: Oil and sugar are part
of our global economy and they
have been so much involved in

00:06:55.982 --> 00:07:02.121 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
the unequal systems creating
poverty, creating domination,
repression, colonization.

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:09.529 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
We define the modern relation
with slavery as this
transformation of human person

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.597 align:start line:10% position:10% size:58%
into goods, into sugar.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:19.105 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
Oil is much more problematic
and oil is definitely linked to
colonization.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:24.911 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
So you have this sugar that is
becoming black, and then this
incredible moment of, "Oh,

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:25.912 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
my God.

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:26.913 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
This is it."

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.981 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
It starts to collapse.

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:38.558 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ELLIOT: Kader uses his
colonial experience as a kind of
starting point for feelings of

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:43.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
exclusion or equality, in every
way.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:50.336 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt;<i> In his first major</i>
<i>installation work, Kader</i>
<i>decided to tackle issues of</i>

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.405 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
<i>exclusion head on.</i>

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:59.045 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
<i>Set on a beach in the Canary</i>
<i>Islands, "Holy Land" was a</i>
<i>reaction to the plight of</i>

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:02.381 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
<i>refugees arriving by sea from</i>
<i>Africa.</i>

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:08.221 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I wanted to do something that
would work in the reality of an
ethical project.

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:13.593 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I thought that when the refugees
come from the sea, they need to
see signs which indicate that

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.863 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
the earth in that direction,
you know?

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:24.270 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
So I decided to set up on the
beach a hundred mirrors facing
the sea.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:31.277 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
So coming from the sea you would
have seen a line of glittering
light as a signal of "there is

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.346 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
something here."

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:39.752 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
The ocean on that part of the
globe, it's a cemetery.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:43.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
That is the reason that I chose
shapes which looks like graves.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.961 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: That's really
beautiful because on the one
hand it has a very manifests

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
political meaning, because you
look into them but you don't see
yourself, you see the reflected

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.404 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
landscape and light in the
mirrors themselves.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:03.075 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; KADER: We think that what we
look at the mirror is real,
but it's not.

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:08.514 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
When people reach the beach they
expect something, but what they
will find also it's not what

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.816 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
they have dreamt about.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:14.287 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And that's why I call this
installation "Holy Land",
because for them it's a kind of

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:18.324 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
Holy Land but the reality, we
know it when we live in this
side of the model, it's not the

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.393 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
Holy Land.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.696 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; He's someone who struggles.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:29.735 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
He pushes himself to actually
capture...

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:33.739 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
...what he feels is wrong.

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:38.411 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
This is really at the heart of
the work, because the work is
about healing.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:45.751 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt;<i> Sidestepping overtly</i>

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:51.424 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%

00:09:56.462 --> 00:10:01.901 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; KADER: "Ghost" is definitely
a sort of incarnation of the
fact that we come from nothing

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.337 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
and we go to nothing.

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:08.841 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
The confrontation that you have
with this work scares you a
little bit because it represents

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.910 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
death.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:14.747 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: You approach this
installation from the back and
only when you see the figures

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
from the front you see it's not
solid matter sculptures, it's
only aluminum foil.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:25.691 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And it's very beautiful but it's
also scary at the same time
because the figure has no face.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:34.233 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; KADER: I started to do the
first ghost wrapping my mother
with aluminum foil because I was

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.801 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
looking at her praying.

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:41.941 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
After I cast the body, I
discovered that it was extremely
fascinating to see that the void

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:46.812 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
inside this sculptor was even
more important than the skin.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:52.752 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: Whatever material he
uses, it is always trying to
mirror or find an expression for

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.253 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
the topic he tackles.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.759 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
So there's a very connection
between topic and material.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:06.265 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; KADER: The fact that I kept
these work fragile is very
important, it is an ephemeral

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.334 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
work.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt;<i> In "Ghardaia", Kader would</i>
<i>continue his use of ephemeral</i>
<i>materials but in a more</i>

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.308 align:start line:10% position:10% size:45%
<i>political context.</i>

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
<i>The work juxtaposes a model of</i>
<i>the ancient North African city</i>
<i>of Ghardaia, made up of</i>

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:30.489 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
<i>couscous with an image of</i>
<i>Le Corbusier, the godfather of</i>
<i>modern Western architecture.</i>

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:36.929 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; KADER: Ghardaia is a city in
Algeria that has been
influencing modernist

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:43.035 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
architecture through the eye of
Le Corbusier who was let's say
the first architect who really

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:49.408 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
get amazed by this incredible
11th century architecture made
of clay.

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:53.813 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
I think you have here definitely
what I would call the sort of,
colonization of the knowledge.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:58.350 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
On one hand you have this
emerging new architecture in the
West that are part of this

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:01.654 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
Western superiority, if not
supremacy, you know?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.193 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
But the legacy of this is
tradition, and not even Western
tradition.

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:13.799 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: Corbusier, like his
modernist pals, didn't believe
really in retaining an existing

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start line:10% position:10% size:20%
culture.

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:19.071 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
They wanted a tabula rasa and
they tended destroy what was
there.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.173 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
Kader Attia repairs that.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.947 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
He's again finding a way of
creating a rapprochement between
this idea of modernity, erasing

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:33.486 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
everything that went before it,
and bringing back the life and
the culture of what has always

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.921 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
been there.

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:40.292 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; KADER: I used couscous,
it's the main dish of North
African population since 3,000

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:46.499 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
years, as a cynical dish or
dinner in which posthumously
inviting Le Corbusier and

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:51.637 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
another architect to illustrate
this sort of amnesia we are
living in.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:52.905 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
This has to be repaired.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:13:00.212 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt;<i> Kader's interest in</i>
<i>repairing the relationship</i>
<i>between Western and non-Western</i>

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:05.918 align:end line:10% position:88% size:78%
<i>culture would reach a new level</i>
<i>of analysis in a powerful and</i>
<i>disturbing work he presented</i>

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:09.622 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
<i>at the dOCUMENTA (13)</i>
<i>exhibition in Germany.</i>

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:16.896 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; The work was called "Repair
From Occident to
Extra-Occidental Cultures."

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:22.468 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
He had a system of shelves where
he put different things like
sculptures, found objects,

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:31.043 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
books and many other things to
kind of counter African and
European cultural traditions and

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.112 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
mix them together.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: What he did was to
juxtapose photographs and actual
busts of veterans of the First

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:44.757 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
World War who'd had the most
crude plastic surgery.

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:53.098 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And these were shown alongside
African heads, where
scarification, the extension of

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:59.638 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
lower lips or earlobes, is a
cultural ritual, it's a kind of
fashion.

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:04.944 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: There was also a very
impressive slide projection,
with two slides next to each

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.645 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
other.

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:09.949 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
There were faces of soldiers
from the First World War.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:15.287 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
For example, there was broken
cultural artifacts from Africa.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:20.526 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: So he's interested in
finding the continuities between
these things, bringing them

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:24.330 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
together and creating kind of
suture between them.

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:29.702 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: He takes repair as a
philosophical concept but also
as a social concept.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:35.241 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; KADER: It was very important
for me to involve the audience
slowly into this complexity of

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:38.410 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
the repair by very simple
analogies.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:43.716 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
So, analogies between an injured
faces and a broken object.

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
At the beginning, the repair of
the body was similar to repair
of any items.

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:52.358 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
But then you look at the images
and you discover that at the end
f the war, the repair of the

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:56.128 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
faces was almost perfect.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:59.298 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
The West, when we break
something, we change it.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:04.870 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
And if we do not change it,
we repair it and remove the
injury, it has to disappear.

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:12.311 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
In traditional society,
repairing means to give to the
object a new life, a new form,

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:18.150 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
but still keeping the trace of
the injury like a sign of the
time and the history of the

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:20.219 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
object.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.825 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: Every time a
person repairs an object, they
add to its history.

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:33.532 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
It sorts of shakes up
assumptions that objects last
only a brief period of time and

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.869 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
that we have to go and consume
more.

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.873 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
&gt;&gt; Colonization.

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.377 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
(Speaking French indistinctly)

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> French-Algerian artist</i>
<i>Kader Attia is currently based</i>
<i>in Berlin where his book lined</i>

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:59.425 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:04.530 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; We are here in my studio,
and it's not a big studio.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.998 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
This place is not a brain.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:12.971 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I hope my brain is not that
messy, but it is actually a sort
of platform for work and

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:18.944 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
thinking and feeding my own
creative processes.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:25.217 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
Goes from the arts, modern art,
the whole top is about surgery,
then colonization, architecture

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:26.385 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
definitely.

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:30.222 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
I have many object here, not
only books obviously, I have
some masks.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:35.527 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
It represents this sort of brain
stroke from which you can wakeup
with your mouth like this and

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:36.528 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
your nose like this.

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:41.467 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And I think this is extremely
interesting because we're either
representing the heinous,

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:47.806 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
so that probably invited in some
ritual to cool down the bad
spirit of this heinous so that

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.110 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
it doesn't-- it won't attack
the village.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
Or it can be a celebration of a
sort of rarity.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
Beauty basically means rarity,
but those people were rare,
so why we consider them as

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:05.124 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
monsters?

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:10.462 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
&gt;&gt;<i> In 2016, Kader Attia was</i>

<i>"Reflecting Memory."</i>

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:25.043 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: The exhibition
begins with a piece of matlouh
bread, baked by his mother, cut

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.813 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
in half and fixed to the wall.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:35.454 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
And this bread is a symbolic
entrance into a series of works
that continue with a film of

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:39.258 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
45 minutes called<i> Reflecting</i>
<i>Memory.</i>

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:45.697 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; KADER: We started with a very
physical matter, what we call
the phantom limb.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:53.705 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
The fact that some people who
have lost a leg or an arm, they
still feel this limb.

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:56.809 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
Some of them wake up during the
night and they feel--
(Gasping)

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:59.011 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
"It's back," and sadly, not.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:06.785 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: When you watch
the film, you realize that what
you think is a man or woman

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:13.325 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
standing there with all their
complete body, is effectively
the mirror reflection of

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.394 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
somebody who has lost a leg.

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:24.236 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: They look at
themselves whole, reflected in
a mirror, doubling their leg or

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:29.675 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
their arm, and then the mirror
is taken away, and the
subconscious recognizes for the

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.743 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
first time the loss of a limb.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:37.583 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: It's a method
that is used to heal the
problem and the pain of the

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.052 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
phantom limb.

00:18:40.118 --> 00:18:46.692 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
So he's interested in the
haunting that remains within our
consciousness.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:51.430 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: What is really
compelling about this film is
that rather than taking one

00:18:51.497 --> 00:19:01.273 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
medical fact or psychological
state, he moves from these
sufferers if you like, to music,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:09.515 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
to the Holocaust, to the
psychiatrist, and again he finds
ways of dissolving boundaries

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:14.720 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
and bringing all these different
thoughts of contemporary culture
together.

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:23.262 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; KADER: It became clear that
there was a metaphor between
the individual amputated body

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:25.330 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
and the social group.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:32.070 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
What has happened for the
descendants of the Holocaust for
instance?

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:35.140 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
This generation of people who
have lived with the
disappearance of their

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.475 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
grandparents or parents.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:43.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
It remain as a traumatic ghost,
a phantom limb haunting them.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:49.588 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
As long as we deny this
(Unclear) process, could it be
cultural or physical, you get

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:52.057 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
confronted to repair.

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:56.962 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
What I'm showing here is the
phantom limb of cultural
complexes.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:04.336 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: The central
piece of the work after you've
seen the film, is 20 plinths

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:11.843 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
with sculptures, which in
the first instance you think
belong to so-called tribal art.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.448 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
But when you look at them more
carefully you see immediately
that they are the packaging of

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.750 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
electronic equipment.

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:25.123 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It's that immediate flash, the
fact that you can't stop
yourself from thinking that

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:30.395 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
you're looking at African masks
when you're actually looking at
something as banal as a piece

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:31.630 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
of packaging.

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:35.434 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
It evokes the phantom limb
within the history of art.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:43.709 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt;<i> Recently, Kader has taken his</i>
<i>call for repair out of the</i>
<i>gallery and into the world by</i>

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:48.146 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
<i>opening a new space for art</i>
<i>and discussion in the</i>
<i>multiethnic neighbourhood</i>

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:50.215 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
<i>of Gare du Nord in Paris.</i>

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:58.757 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>Consisting of a café,</i>
<i>bookstore, exhibition space,</i>
<i>and conference centre,</i>

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:04.730 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
<i>La Colonie aims to unite</i>
<i>thinkers, artists, activists</i>
<i>and members of the public to</i>

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:10.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
<i>help mend many of the problems</i>
<i>facing the modern world.</i>

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:14.339 align:start line:74% position:10% size:63%
&gt;&gt; La Colonie is not only
criticizing the colonial
history, it's actually

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:19.378 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
criticizing the coloniality
of now, the colonization of
classes, the colonization of

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:24.416 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
gender, of the domination of one
part of population on the other.

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:29.221 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; CLEMENTINE: If you look at
the Colonie's logo, you'll see
it's crossed out.

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
So it isn't a colony in that
sense, it's an anti-colony as
well.

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:38.930 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It's interesting that it
happens in Paris because of
course the history of artist run

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.732 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
spaces began in Paris.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:45.437 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
(Speaking French)
&gt;&gt; IWONA: It's a space for his
neighbourhood, for those kids

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:48.373 align:start line:10% position:10% size:73%
who have nothing, and I think
that is a gesture.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
It's something which I found
very powerful and moving, that
he wants to share the success

00:21:54.346 --> 00:22:00.118 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
that he's had recently and
actually bring other people into
it.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.992 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ELLEN: Kader's work is doing
something that religion might
have done to people in earlier

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:07.993 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
ages.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:14.132 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
It kind of touches you on a
level that you cannot really
grasp.

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:17.636 align:start line:79% position:10% size:58%
It shows you why art is
important.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:23.375 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Whatever subject he handles,
he does it because he's
interested in the relationship

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:26.712 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
between injury and repair.

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:33.018 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
And this makes his work into a
process of remediation.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:41.793 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; IWONA: Kader Attia is an
artist who encompasses activism
but without didacticism.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:49.901 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
He shows the way that cultures
can absorb pain, trauma,
destruction, and yet, still be

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:51.803 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
creative.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.575 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; ELLIOT: I think he's an
artist very much concerned with
moral thought, and that's

00:22:56.641 --> 00:23:02.948 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
what makes him important for me,
and that's something that
informs all of his work and I

00:23:03.014 --> 00:23:06.151 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
wish there were more artists
like that.

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:13.892 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; KADER: As an artist, I could
spend my life doing aesthetics
and decorating the mind, but I

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:20.265 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
think there is a sort of moment
now, of emergency in terms of
the world we are living in now

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:27.172 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
and how it can be corrected,
how it can be repaired, for
better future.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.741 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
I want to take care of that.
