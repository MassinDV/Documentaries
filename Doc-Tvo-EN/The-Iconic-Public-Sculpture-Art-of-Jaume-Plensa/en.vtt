&gt;&gt; I was born in Barcelona.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:20.740 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It's a beautiful town, in my
opinion, because it keeps,
still the certain human scale.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.043 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
Also at the same time I was
born in a city with the sea.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.382 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
It's probably one of the most
beautiful elements in town.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:36.823 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It was great to live in a city
in where you have the most
beautiful museum, with artists

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
like Miro, which I love it when
I was a child.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:45.865 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
And of course architects like
Gaudi.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:53.439 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
My father was always playing
piano, and my mother was, uh,
singing.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:59.479 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
My father had an upright piano
with two sliding doors, and many
times when I was really tiny, I

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:04.584 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
was hiding myself inside the
piano, and he was playing
without his knowledge that I was

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
in, and I really discovered the
beauty of the vibration of
material.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:16.162 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
(Soft piano music playing)
That vibration was completely
the vibration of life,

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
everything was vibrating around
me.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
And I guess, I could understand
today how influential has been
that experience in my work.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:33.246 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And many times I'm thinking that
all my life, all my wish to be
an artist is coming from the

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.316 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
interior of my father's piano.

&gt;&gt; WOMAN: That's what he's
engaged with, he's taking
immaterial extraordinary ideas,

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
and pulling them into a kind of
a material form.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:59.238 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And he uses in that process
many different materials, from
glass to steel to paper.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:04.844 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
But actually what he's doing is
he's capturing light, he's
taking light and molding light

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.412 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
in a very particular way.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:13.853 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And through that process, a kind
of enlightenment happens for the
people who engage with his work.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:27.400 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; Where we stand now used to be
the old coal tip at Sutton
Manor, and it was a bleak, and

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
it was a desolate, and it was a
dirty place.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:37.877 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
We've had 400 years of mining
here, so when all the pits went,
the whole area struggled.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:42.782 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
We entered a competition in 2003
called "The Big Art Project."

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.755 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
What it was looking for was to
put something back into a
community that'd had the heart

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:54.894 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
and soul ripped out of it by
political or economic measures,
and St. Helen's was just a

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.196 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
perfect place.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:03.102 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; They explained to me about
the mines, the colliery, the
peat, about things that I never

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.238 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
listened before, honestly.

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:12.345 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
One of the ex-miners, when they
told me "Jaume, when you are in
the pit, 300 metres under, the

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:16.916 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
darkness is so deep that light
becomes a dream."

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:22.755 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I said "Wow," because I'm from
the Mediterranean, and for me,
light is so normal, so-- I never

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.657 align:start line:85% position:10% size:75%
thought about light, honestly.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:31.030 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
Thanks to them, light for me
changed completely the concept.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:36.903 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; We spoke to him about what
we'd like on the site, and he
unveiled a giant miner's lamp.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.840 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
(Laughing)
Which put us in a very funny
position with him.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:44.510 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
We had to go back to him and
said "You've kept us in the
past."

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:50.216 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
He said "Well, this was my
original idea, which I scrapped,
because I thought you may not

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.317 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
like it."

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:56.022 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
And then he unveiled<i> Dream</i> for
us, and we all went "Wow!

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.593 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
This is it, this is what we
like."

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.898 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; The dream of those guys was
really to stop with the past,
and to really look into the

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:06.899 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
future.

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:12.638 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
I give the title to my piece,
<i>Dream,</i> because finally, it's
the portrait of a girl dreaming.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:16.809 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
It's with the eyes closed, she's
not really interested about the
landscape.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.846 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
She's really interested about
the interior of the Earth.

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:23.282 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
Really, I guess, the soul of all
these people.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:29.188 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; When they put the final piece
on top, we had six burly miners
who'd been with it from day one,

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:32.692 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
and me included, we all wanted
to cry.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:40.099 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
You know, because you can never
envisage how horrible this place
was to see.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:46.506 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Lorries bringing up something of
a quality of whiteness was just
fantastic.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:58.050 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; The day of the opening, a few
thousand people came, all the
village came.

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:02.655 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
It was really probably one of
the most unforgettable days from
my life.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:12.298 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: Today is International
Yoga Day, and I thought it'd be
a wonderful opportunity to bring

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:17.470 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
the community of St. Helen's
together and do a yoga
celebration in front of the

<i>Dream.</i>

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:22.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.877 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%

hobby, and I love it.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.815 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And then as soon as I saw that
it was here, I was like "That is
gonna be the perfect place to do

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.751 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
yoga."

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:36.355 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; It feels euphoric, it feels,
um, slightly levitational, if I
can say that.

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:39.458 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%

and to feel at peace.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:43.930 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
You feel very grounded and
rooted and connected with the
Earth.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.432 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%

the like, 20, 30 years.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:51.003 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
I remember this area being a
slag heap, so this is a great
moment for the miners that

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.772 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
worked here.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.540 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; It's kinda industrial, but...

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:58.444 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
It-- because it's white, it
looks really clean and pure, and
that's why it looks quite

00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.445 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
spiritual.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:03.950 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

it's really-- it's really
beautiful.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:09.655 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%

open, you know-- the paper, it

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:39.785 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%

I just opened it... put it back.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:47.627 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%

&gt;&gt; WOMAN: I've seen his work in

haven't failed to be amazed at

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.384 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
how people respond to them.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.388 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
People who have no notion of who
this man is, this artist.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:22.228 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And one of the things Jaume is
really intent on doing is taking
that situation, where people who

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:28.801 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
don't normally engage with art
find themselves falling into
this art, and, um, becoming

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:32.004 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
absorbed by it.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:38.878 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; When I'm doing a show in a
museum or in a gallery, of
course it's art because it's in

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:45.051 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
a gallery, or it's in a museum,
but when it's in the public
space, who knows?

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:53.492 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
Public space has specific rules,
and the way that people are
always disappointed, because

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.761 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
whatever you do, it's wrong.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:10:02.668 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
Okay, but I guess that is part
of the game, and I like that,
honestly, because you really

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:07.473 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
are playing completely without
any context.

&gt;&gt; TRANSLATOR: He's an artist
who has always said that one of
his goals was to look for

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:15.214 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
beauty, to take beauty to the
people.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.416 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
And nowadays, that's almost

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:43.409 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
You must dream about something
that becomes a beacon, something

Hindi, and Latin.

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:29.155 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt; I think what he's doing there
is using information to
construct a sense of identity,

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.257 align:start line:10% position:10% size:53%
or a sense of person.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:38.964 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And how he uses that information
exactly, to convey the identity,
changes from work to work.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.901 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%

sculpture interesting.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:17.236 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%

whom bringing art into being
doesn't stop him dreaming.

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:55.941 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

something and then looks for
technical solutions to make it

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:58.310 align:start line:85% position:10% size:13%
real.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:04.049 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%

work, you wonder at its
complexity.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:08.954 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; JAUME: That is one of those
kinds of works that I'm doing
that people are invited to come

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:12.691 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%

The concept of a mirror, when
you are in front of a mirror,
and your image has been

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.804 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
reflected completely in the
mirror.

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.641 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
And you have a dialogue with
yourself, finally.

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:35.314 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
And you can understand evolution
of time, who you are...

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:41.287 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
What is your-- what your dreams
are, and sometimes the person
which are looking to you have

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:45.891 align:start line:79% position:10% size:68%
not exactly the same as you
imagine to be.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:53.599 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Jaume has spoken about the
potential poetry of diversity,
and that's a really key part of

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.167 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
his work.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:14:01.340 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
That we consider ourselves as
humanity without division,
dissolving boundaries, and

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:02.641 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
that's his vision.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:08.981 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%

extraordinarily concentrated
places of awareness and

understanding.

piece, actually, because when
people are inside, they really

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:20.292 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
could see the world completely
through the text.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.995 align:start line:79% position:10% size:63%
I guess it's an homage to
humanity.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:29.902 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
Also about the mix of different
alphabets, it's a celebration of
life and how well we can be when

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.203 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
we are together.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:36.342 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
That, I think, is for me very
important as a concept.

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:43.849 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And I also adopted my range of
alphabets, music, and a kind of
silent conversation, because

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:46.185 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
they are talking about sound.

similar-- the moment when
everything seems like a liquid,

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:25.324 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
and when they suddenly get cold,
and it's fixed in one shape,
which was very difficult to

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.325 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
correct.

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:49.835 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%

basilica, because it's a temple

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:55.007 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
with a function, which means a

00:17:55.073 --> 00:18:00.846 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:33.912 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

So Jaume, basically he has the
idea, and he follows the whole
process, but more in a poetical

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.653 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
way now.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.391 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

pass this work from imagine to
reality.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:50.529 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
I have a fantastic team that
helps me to do that.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:55.934 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
We have to prepare a lot of
moulds, to follow exactly the
position of the ropes, and then

00:18:56.001 --> 00:19:00.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to try to give the human touch.

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:05.611 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
Every time that you bring a
piece in a different place,
especially here, well you are

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:08.947 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
very curious to know if your

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:14.653 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

moment, the boats arriving with
the big crates with the big

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.658 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%

start to bring only the segments
inside.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:22.528 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
And I realized that the scale
was perfect.

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:29.935 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
The piece is about 92 cubic

emptiness, as one of the most

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:34.239 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
beautiful parts of spirituality.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:41.813 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

itself inside the church of San

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:13.278 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
Total clarity, through which you
can see the city.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:20.118 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
You can see the person next to
you, it's like a luminous
presence.

&gt;&gt; JAUME: I had lunch with the
abbot, and he said something
that I completely agree.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:30.862 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
He said when the basilica needed
a piece of art since the 16th
century, that piece was always

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.164 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
contemporary.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.966 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
Why not today?

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:37.035 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
It's hard for me to imagine when
the piece was in the studio.

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:40.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
It seems that it was here since
always.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:50.048 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%

&gt;&gt; Probably one of his most
important works, and the one
which in some ways defines him,

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:59.691 align:start line:79% position:10% size:60%
is the Crown Fountain in
Chicago.

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:04.429 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
It's an extraordinary work of
two towers made of glass bricks.

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:11.069 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
And out of those glass bricks
emerges an ever-changing series
of faces, and they are the faces

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.871 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
of the people of Chicago.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:18.977 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And out of their mouths spouts
water to form a shallow lake
between the two towers.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:24.483 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And of course it becomes a place
where people congregate, where
they play, where they see

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:25.617 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
themselves.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:29.554 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
It's an extraordinary point of
self-identification.

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
&gt;&gt; JAUME: Water for us is life.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.929 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
It means life because our body
is probably 60% of water.

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:44.002 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
Fresh water is a rare privilege
and probably the next wars will
be for the water, not for the

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:45.504 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
petrol.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:50.008 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%
I remember in my childhood
walking with my mother in
Barcelona.

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:55.847 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
The gargoyles, because they were
like monsters, like very strange
animals, even a little bit

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:58.050 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
disgusting, some of them.

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:02.587 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
But always with this mouth open,
and spouting water from the
mouth.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:07.192 align:start line:74% position:10% size:68%
And when I'd been thinking
about the Crown Fountain, I
decided to do it.

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:16.034 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
It's funny because my pieces

today allowed me to make new

living in town, but not fix it
in one position.

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:25.544 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
It continues to be alive, and
that was my intention.

You should cultivate intuition,
and you must keep a certain
naive attitude.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:55.974 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
You must be very arrogant in the
way to defend your art, but very
humble as a-- a person.

I prefer to try to be a person,
and dreaming about how to grow
up as a person, I guess art is

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:14.493 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
a consequence of that.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:19.898 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
It's not a job, it's not a

look at reality.

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:23.502 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
For me, the most beautiful way
to talk about it is a way to
breathe.
