there's-- there's multiple

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.735 align:start line:10% position:10% size:68%
narratives, and different
strands that have been
developing over a number of

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
years, so some of my art
projects involve science and
engineering, um, and perception.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:54.280 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
And others involve sort of music

sort of playful public

audiences on many different
levels.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:22.242 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

like, sometimes obvious things,
but use them in very new and

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.678 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%

had last winter in-- in the

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:36.015 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
south west of England, where

cars floating down, um, roads.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:40.653 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

up with this very sublime,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.492 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%

or-- or tidal surge.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:59.539 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
The imagery for a set of fishing
boats abandoned, or that would
have been dumped, perhaps, in

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:05.511 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
the middle of the woodland, came
from that kind of experience.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:11.618 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
The boats will act as a--
a venue for all sorts of-- um,
lectures and performances.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.189 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
One of my slight concerns is
that people have heard about the
project and they go to see the

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:21.494 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
boats in the woods, there may be
a percentage of the population
who will go, "But that's--

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.930 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
that's just some boats in the
wood."

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:28.401 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%

of sense of self doubt about it.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:32.438 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
I mean, we've got all these

it's at what point do you start

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.040 align:end line:85% position:90% size:80%
making artwork for other people?

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.041 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
You know.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:39.579 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
What I try and do with all my

of, different points of entry.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:44.917 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
So that, you know, a four-year-
old child would be able to
appreciate and explore this

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:49.055 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
installation in one way, but
a marine biologist will think
about it in another, and an art

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.224 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
curator will think about it in
another.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.028 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
So that there's enough there
for everybody, really.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.535 align:start line:74% position:10% size:65%

projects I create are--
are ideas-driven.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:09.709 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
So they're-- they stem from a
particular concept, or a brief
that I'm given.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.647 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:28.928 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%

those ideas and actually make
them happen.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:38.371 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
The idea for Sky Orchestra came
from visiting Tunisia, and I was
staying in a small town on the

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:42.842 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
edge of the desert, um, called
Douz, right in the south of
Tunisia.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.114 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
And in the middle of the night,
um, as I was laying in this sort
of dark hotel room, a minaret

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.383 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
started calling right on the
edge of town.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.287 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And a few minutes later, another
minaret started calling,
slightly closer.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:57.623 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
And after a while there were,
like, ten minarets calling
from all different parts of the

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
town, right across the city, it
was a very beautiful experience.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.932 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

into this space on the edge of
sleep.

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:09.502 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

balloonist, and it sort of came

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.941 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
to me, this idea that, actually,
I could recreate that edge of
sleep... musical, sculptural

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
experience, for the public, by
strapping speakers on to hot air
balloons, and playing music to

affect people's sleep.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:28.621 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%

our little gadgets, our mobile

fragments into all these little
cubes.

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:56.422 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%

perceptual, sort of, phenomena
of that.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:06.365 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
We actually scanned my daughter

model and pixelated it.

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:12.571 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
And then the entire artwork was
made by water-jet cutting layers
and layers of aluminium, and

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.206 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
sticking all those together.

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:19.245 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%

little stickers, all the
different squares.

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:23.416 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
Um, my wife came over and saw
the artwork, and said, "Well,

actually the performer was often
having the most amount of fun.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:16.135 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%

that's an invitation for the

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:12.284 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
Um, and you'd often see a
brightly-coloured image of Ebola
used to illustrate a story.

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:16.555 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
But I realised quite quickly
through doing a little bit of
research that actually viruses

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:17.656 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
don't have any colour.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:20.526 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
That they're actually smaller
than the wavelength of light.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:26.999 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
So about ten years ago I made a
small glass sculpture of HIV,
as something to contemplate and

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:28.233 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
think about.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.638 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
Um, and people seemed to like
it, it was bought by a museum.

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:39.011 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
And now it's led to this massive
body of glass microbiology
artwork, uh, that is presented

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
in museums all round the world.

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:50.222 align:start line:74% position:10% size:73%
What I'm doing is I'm just
making accurate renditions of
the virus.

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:54.459 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
They're about a million times
larger than the real thing, but
it-- it makes them incredibly

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.460 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
beautiful.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:20:00.532 align:end line:74% position:90% size:80%
So you're attracted to them, but
then when you realise that this,
um, sculpture is actually

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:04.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
representing HIV, for instance,
you're kind of repelled by it.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:11.577 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
So that creates a tension, and
I suppose I'm interested in that
tension.

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:17.249 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
The photographs of these glass
sculptures actually have now
become part of the vocabulary of

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:18.383 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
virology.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.552 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
So they get used by scientists
all the time.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.455 align:start line:79% position:10% size:65%
Go on book covers, go into
medical journals.

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
So it's a sort of-- there's an
unexpected outcome, I think,
to lots of my art projects.

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:32.197 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
Um, and I think a good artwork
will do that.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:42.441 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
As an artist, at the moment,
I'm managing about 16 different
art projects with-- um, that I'm

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.176 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
developing concurrently.

00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:47.946 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
Um... and they all have their
own time scale.

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:53.085 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It's a bit stressful at times,
um, but generally I have a--
a lot of fun.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:21:00.692 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
♪
A lot of my art projects, they
seem sort of disconnected,

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:04.496 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
but there are sort of narratives
that connect them.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:13.372 align:end line:79% position:90% size:80%
&gt;&gt;<i> Today, Luke is installing his</i>
<i>latest artwork,</i> Withdrawn.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:20.145 align:start line:74% position:10% size:78%
<i>He's gone back to his roots,</i>
<i>and created a large-scale</i>
<i>installation that he hopes will</i>

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.881 align:end line:85% position:88% size:78%
<i>spark the public's imagination.</i>

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:27.519 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in the-- the
whole experience of an artwork.

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:33.558 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
So for some people, the journey
towards this artwork will start
when they hear about it in the

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:36.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
newspaper and they decide to go
with their kids.

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:40.098 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:78%
And now, they might drive up or
they'll cycle to the car park,
and then there'll be a walk

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:43.201 align:start line:79% position:10% size:75%
into the woods to get here, to
discover it with their kids.

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:47.606 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:80%
And that journey is all part of
the artistic experience, really,
from my perspective.

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:51.309 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
And what you'll end up with at
the end of it is a set of
memories.

00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:56.548 align:start line:74% position:10% size:70%
And it'll be the memories,
fundamentally, that is the--
the legacy for this project.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.555 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt;<i> And just like Luke's other</i>
<i>artworks, today he's attracted</i>
<i>a lot of press.</i>

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:07.225 align:start line:10% position:10% size:70%
<i>Much to the delight of those</i>
<i>who commissioned the piece.</i>

00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:09.461 align:start line:10% position:10% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Personally I think it's
absolutely exceptional.

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:13.398 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
We're just, uh, we're trying to
recall if we've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.466 align:start line:10% position:10% size:35%
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:19.805 align:start line:10% position:10% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Bringing real world objects
into a woodland, it's a very
particular kind of magical

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:21.740 align:start line:10% position:10% size:28%
experience.

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:24.743 align:start line:10% position:10% size:78%
&gt;&gt; And we've had the privilege
of coming first thing this
morning, haven't we, and seeing

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.744 align:start line:10% position:10% size:48%
it as the sun rose.

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.579 align:start line:10% position:10% size:50%
It's been wonderful.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:31.650 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
&gt;&gt; The way Luke works is that
he's always got, like, a long
list of fabulous ideas, and, you

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.685 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
know, things that he'd just love
to achieve.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:37.456 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
He thinks it's about finding the
right person at the right time,
in the right place, who will

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:40.459 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:78%
just grab it, and work with him
collaboratively to deliver it.

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:44.362 align:end line:10% position:90% size:80%
And that's exactly what happened
with<i> Withdrawn.</i>

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:51.803 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
♪
&gt;&gt; LUKE: I feel like I've just
learned how to be an artist, I

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.708 align:start line:74% position:10% size:80%
suppose, and I'm sort of,
beginning to, sort of open my
wings, spread my wings and get a

00:22:56.775 --> 00:23:00.912 align:start line:79% position:10% size:70%
sense of what I'm capable of
doing.

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:04.483 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
To create artwork, it doesn't
have to be huge and large-scale.

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:09.588 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It can-- you can do, sort of,
outrageous, innovative,
ground-breaking artwork, on an

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.790 align:start line:79% position:10% size:73%
artwork that's as big as your
hand.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:15.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
So it's not always about scale,
or complexity.

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:22.067 align:start line:74% position:10% size:75%
It can just be about simple
ideas, um, that can change the
world.
